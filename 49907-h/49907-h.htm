somewhat different from that of any other guides at
present before the public. They do not compete or clash
with such existing works; they are rather intended to
supplement than to supplant them. My purpose is not to
direct the stranger through the streets and squares of an
unknown town towards the buildings or sights which he
may desire to visit; still less is it my design to give him
practical information about hotels, cab fares, omnibuses, tramways,
and other every-day material conveniences. For such
details, the traveller must still have recourse to the trusty
pages of his Baedeker, his Joanne, or his Murray. I desire
rather to supply the tourist who wishes to use his travel as a
means of culture with such historical and antiquarian information
as will enable him to understand, and therefore to
enjoy, the architecture, sculpture, painting, and minor arts of
the towns he visits. In one word, it is my object to give the
reader in a very compendious form the result of all those
inquiries which have naturally suggested themselves to my
own mind during thirty-five years of foreign travel, the solution
of which has cost myself a good deal of research, thought, and
labour, beyond the facts which I could find in the ordinary
handbooks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For several years past I have devoted myself to collecting
and arranging material for a set of books to embody the idea
<span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span>
I had thus entertained. I earnestly hope they may meet a
want on the part of tourists, especially Americans, who, so far
as my experience goes, usually come to Europe with an honest
and reverent desire to learn from the Old World whatever of
value it has to teach them, and who are prepared to take an
amount of pains in turning their trip to good account which
is both rare and praiseworthy. For such readers I shall call
attention at times to other sources of information.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These guide-books will deal more particularly with the Great
Towns where objects of art and antiquity are numerous.
In every one of them, the general plan pursued will be somewhat
as follows. First will come the inquiry why a town ever
gathered together at all at that particular spot—what induced
the aggregation of human beings rather there than elsewhere.
Next, we shall consider why that town grew to social or political
importance and what were the stages by which it assumed its
present shape. Thirdly, we shall ask why it gave rise to that
higher form of handicraft which we know as Art, and towards
what particular arts it especially gravitated. After that, we
shall take in detail the various strata of its growth or development,
examining the buildings and works of art which they
contain in historical order, and, as far as possible, tracing the
causes which led to their evolution. In particular, we shall
lay stress upon the origin and meaning of each structure as
an organic whole, and upon the allusions or symbols which
its fabric embodies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A single instance will show the method upon which I intend
to proceed better than any amount of general description.
A church, as a rule, is built over the body or relics of a
particular saint, in whose special honour it was originally
erected. That saint was usually one of great local importance
at the moment of its erection, or was peculiarly implored
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>
against plague, foreign enemies, or some other pressing and
dreaded misfortune. In dealing with such a church, then, I
endeavour to show what were the circumstances which led to
its erection, and what memorials of these circumstances it still
retains. In other cases it may derive its origin from some
special monastic body—Benedictine, Dominican, Franciscan—and
may therefore be full of the peculiar symbolism and historical
allusion of the order who founded it. Wherever I have
to deal with such a church, I try as far as possible to exhibit
the effect which its origin had upon its architecture and decoration;
to trace the image of the patron saint in sculpture or
stained glass throughout the fabric; and to set forth the connection
of the whole design with time and place, with order
and purpose. In short, instead of looking upon monuments
of the sort mainly as the product of this or that architect, I
look upon them rather as material embodiments of the spirit
of the age—crystallizations, as it were, in stone and bronze, in
form and colour, of great popular enthusiasms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By thus concentrating attention on what is essential and
important in a town, I hope to give in a comparatively short
space, though with inevitable conciseness, a fuller account than
is usually given of the chief architectural and monumental
works of the principal art-cities. In dealing with Paris, for
example, I shall have little to say about such modern constructions
as the Champs Elysées or the Eiffel Tower; still
less, of course, about the Morgue, the Catacombs, the waxworks
of the Musée Grévin, and the celebrated Excursion in the Paris
Sewers. The space thus saved from vulgar wonders I shall
hope to devote to fuller explanation of Notre-Dame and the
Sainte Chapelle, of the mediæval carvings or tapestries of
Cluny, and of the pictures or sculptures in the galleries of the
Louvre. Similarly in Florence, whatever I save from description
<span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>
of the Cascine and even of the beautiful Viale dei Colli
(where explanation is needless and word-painting superfluous),
I shall give up to the Bargello, the Uffizi, and the Pitti Palace.
The passing life of the moment does not enter into my plan;
I regard each town I endeavour to illustrate mainly as a
museum of its own history.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For this reason, too, I shall devote most attention in every
case to what is locally illustrative, and less to what is merely
adventitious and foreign. In Paris, for instance, I shall have
more to say about truly Parisian art and history, as embodied
in St. Denis, the Île de la Cité, and the shrine of Ste. Geneviève,
than about the Egyptian and Assyrian collections of the Louvre.
In Florence, again, I shall deal rather with the Etruscan remains,
with Giotto and Fra Angelico, with the Duomo and the
Campanile, than with the admirable Memlincks and Rubenses
of the Uffizi and the Pitti, or with the beautiful Van der Goes
of the Hospital of Santa Maria. In Bruges and Brussels,
once more, I shall be especially Flemish; in the Rhine towns,
Rhenish; in Venice, Venetian. I shall assign a due amount
of space, indeed, to the foreign collections, but I shall call
attention chiefly to those monuments or objects which are of
entirely local and typical value.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As regards the character of the information given, it will be
mainly historical, antiquarian, and, above all, explanatory.
I am not a connoisseur—an adept in the difficult modern
science of distinguishing the handicraft of various masters, in
painting or sculpture, by minute signs and delicate inferential
processes. In such matters, I shall be well content to follow
the lead of the most authoritative experts. Nor am I an art-critic—a
student versed in the technique of the studios and the
dialect of the modelling-room. In such matters, again, I shall
attempt little more than to accept the general opinion of the
<span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span>
most discriminative judges. What I aim at rather is to expound
the history and meaning of each work—to put the intelligent
reader in such a position that he may judge for himself of the
æsthetic beauty and success of the object before him. To
recognise the fact that this is a Perseus and Andromeda, that
a St. Barbara enthroned, the other an obscure episode in the
legend of St. Philip, is not art-criticism, but it is often an almost
indispensable prelude to the formation of a right and sound
judgment. We must know what the artist was trying to represent
before we can feel sure what measure of success he has
attained in his representation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the general study of Christian art, alike in architecture,
sculpture, and painting, no treatises are more useful for the
tourist to carry with him for constant reference than Mrs.
Jameson’s <span class='it'>Sacred and Legendary Art</span>, and <span class='it'>Legends of the
Madonna</span> (London, Longmans). For works of Italian art, both
in Italy and elsewhere, Kugler's <span class='it'>Italian Schools of Painting</span> is
an invaluable <span class='it'>vade-mecum</span>. These books should be carried
about by everybody everywhere. Other works of special and
local importance will occasionally be noticed under each particular
city, church, or museum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I cannot venture to hope that handbooks containing such
a mass of facts as these will be wholly free from errors and
misstatements, above all in early editions. I can only beg
those who may detect any such to point them out, without
unnecessary harshness, to the author, care of the publisher,
and if possible to assign reasons for any dissentient opinion.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span><h1 id='or'>ORIGINS OF PARIS</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>P</span></span>ARIS is <span class='bold'>not</span>, like Rome, London, Lyons, <span class='bold'>an inevitable
city</span>. It does not owe its distinctive place, like New
York, Chicago, San Francisco, Melbourne, to natural position
alone. Rather does it resemble Madrid or Berlin in
being in great part of artificial administrative origin. It
stands, no doubt, upon an important navigable river, the
Seine; but its position upon that river, though near the
head of navigation, when judged by the standard of early
times, is not exactly necessary or commanding. Rouen in
mediæval days, Havre at the present moment, are the real
ports of the Seine. The site of Paris is in itself nothing more
than one among the many little groups of willow-clad alluvial
islets which are frequent along the upper reaches of the river.
The modern city owes its special development as a town, first
to its Roman conquerors, then to its bridges, next to its
mediæval counts, last of all to the series of special accidents by
which those counts developed at last into kings of the nascent
kingdom of France, and inheritors of the traditions of the
Frankish sovereigns. It is thus in large part a royal residential
town, depending mainly for prosperity upon its kings, its nobles,
its courts of justice, its parliaments, its university, its clergy, and
its official classes; comparatively little, till quite recent times,
upon the energy and industry of its individual citizens. We
say, as a rule, that Paris is the capital of France; it would be
truer to say that France is the country which has grouped itself
under the rulers of Paris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The name itself points back to the antiquity of some human
aggregation upon this particular spot. It is <span class='bold'>the name of a
tribe</span>, <span class='it'>not</span> that of their capital. The Parisii were a Celtic people
of comparatively small importance, who occupied the banks of
the Seine at the period of the Roman conquest. Their town or
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>
stronghold, Lutetia, called distinctively Lutetia Parisiorum
(Lutetia of the Parisii), was situated, says Cæsar, “in an island
of the river Sequana”—the same which is now called the Île de
la Cité. Two adjacent islands of the same alluvial type have
long since coalesced to form the Île St. Louis; a fourth, the Île
Louviers, is at present enclosed in the mainland of the northern
bank by the modern quays.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This <span class='bold'>stockaded island village</span> of the Parisii was conquered
by the Romans in <span style='font-size:smaller'>B.C.</span> 53. Under Roman rule, it remained at
first an unimportant place, the really large towns of Gaul at
that time being Arles, Nîmes, Marseilles, Bordeaux, and Lyons.
In the north, Treviri was the chief Roman settlement. Towards
the end of the Roman period, however, Paris seems to have
increased in importance, and overflowed a little from the island
to the south bank. The town owed its rapid rise, no doubt, to
the two Roman bridges which here crossed the two branches
of the Seine, probably on the same sites as the modern Petit-Pont
and Pont Notre-Dame. The river formed its highway.
Constantius Chlorus, who lived in Gaul from <span style='font-size:smaller'>A.D.</span> 292 to 306, is
supposed to have built in the faubourg on the south side the
palace of the Thermes, which now forms a part of the Museum
of Cluny. Julian certainly inhabited that palace in 360. The
town was known as Lutetia almost as long as the Roman power
lasted; but after the Frankish invasion (and even in late Roman
times), the name of the tribe superseded that of the ancient
fortress: Lutetia became known as Paris, the stronghold of
the Parisii, just in the same way as the Turones gave their
name to Tours, the Ambiani to Amiens, and the Senones to
Sens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the occupation of Gaul by Clovis (Hlodwig), Paris sank
for a time to the position of <span class='bold'>a mere provincial town</span>. The
Merwing (or Merovingian) kings, the successors of Clovis,
resided as a rule at Orleans or Soissons. The Frankish emperors
and kings of the line of Charlemagne, again (the Karlings
or Carlovingians), held their court for the most part at Aix-la-Chapelle.
The town by the Seine was so completely neglected
under later sovereigns of the Karling line (who were practically
Germans), that during the invasions of the Northmen from 841
to 885 it was left entirely to its own resources. But its count,
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>
Eudes, defended it so bravely from the northern pirates, that
he became the real founder of the French State, the first inaugurator
of France as a separate country, distinct from the
Empire. His provincial city grew into the kernel of a mediæval
monarchy. From his time on, Paris emerges as the capital of
a struggling kingdom, small in extent at first, but gradually
growing till it attained the size which it now possesses. The
Teutonic King of the Franks was reduced for a time to the
rocky fortress of Laon; the <span class='bold'>Count of Paris</span> became Duke of
the French, and then <span class='bold'>King of France</span> in the modern acceptation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the kingdom grew (absorbing by degrees Flanders, Normandy,
Aquitaine, Provence, Champagne, and Burgundy), the
capital grew with it; its limits at various times will be more
fully described in succeeding pages. From first to last, however,
Paris preserved its character as rather the official and
administrative centre than the commercial emporium. Nevertheless,
even under the Romans, its symbol was a ship. Its
double debt to the river and the monarchy is well symbolised
by its mediæval coat of arms, which consists of a vessel under
full sail, surmounted by the <span class='it'>fleur de lis</span> of the French kings, and
crested above by a mural crown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So few remnants of <span class='bold'>Roman Paris</span> exist at our day, that we
will begin our survey with the <span class='bold'>Île de la Cité</span>, the nucleus of the
mediæval town, leaving the scanty earlier relics to be noted later
on in their proper places. But before we proceed to this detailed
description, two other facts of prime importance in the history
of old Paris must be briefly mentioned, because without them
the character of the most ancient buildings in the city cannot
be properly understood. These two facts—even if mythical, yet
facts none the less—are the histories of the two great patron
saints of the early burghers. It is not too much to say that to
the mediæval Parisian, Paris appeared far less as the home of
the kings or the capital of the kingdom than as the <span class='bold'>shrine of
St. Denis</span> and the <span class='bold'>city of Ste. Geneviève</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Universal tradition relates that <span class='bold'>St. Denis</span> was the first
preacher of Christianity in Paris. He is said to have suffered
martyrdom there in the year 270. As the apostle and evangelist
of the town, he was deeply venerated from the earliest
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>
times; but later legend immensely increased his vogue and
his sanctity. On the one hand, he was identified with Dionysius
the Areopagite; on the other hand, he was said to have walked
after his decapitation, bearing his head in his hand, from his
place of martyrdom on the hill of Montmartre (Mons Martyrum),
near the site from which the brand-new church of the Sacré-Cœur
now overlooks the vastly greater modern city, to a spot two
miles away, where a pious lady buried him. On this spot, a
chapel is said to have been erected as early as <span style='font-size:smaller'>A.D.</span> 275, within
five years of his martyrdom; later, Ste. Geneviève, assisted by
the people of Paris, raised a church over his remains on the
same site. In the reign of King Dagobert, the sacred body was
removed to the <span class='bold'>Abbey of St. Denis</span> (see later), which became
the last resting-place of the kings of France. It is probable
that the legend of the saint having carried his head from Montmartre
arose from a misunderstanding of images of the decapitated
bishop, bearing his severed head in his hands as a symbol
of the mode of his martyrdom; but the tale was universally
accepted as true in mediæval days, and is still so accepted by
devout Parisians. Images of St. Denis, in episcopal robes,
carrying his mitred head in his hands, may be looked for on all
the ancient buildings of the city. St. Denis thus represents the
earliest patron saint of Paris—the saint of the primitive Church
and of the period of persecution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second patron saint of the city—the saint of the Frankish
conquest—is locally and artistically even more important. Like
Jeanne d’Arc, she touches the strong French sentiment of
patriotism. <span class='bold'>Ste. Geneviève</span>, a peasant girl of Nanterre (on the
outskirts of Paris), was born in 421, during the stormy times of
the barbarian irruptions. When she was seven years old, St.
Germain, of Auxerre (of whom more will be said under the
church of St. Germain l’Auxerrois), on his way to Britain, saw
<span class='it'>la pucellette Geneviève</span>, and became aware, by divine premonition,
of her predestined glory. When she had grown to woman’s
estate, and was a shepherdess at Nanterre, a barbarian leader
(identified in the legend with Attila, King of the Huns)
threatened to lay siege to the little city. But Geneviève, warned
of God, addressed the people, begging them not to leave their
homes, and assuring them of the miraculous protection of
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>
heaven. And indeed, as it turned out, the barbarians, without
any obvious reason, changed their line of march, and avoided
Paris. Again, when Childeric, the father of Clovis, invested the
city, the people suffered greatly from sickness and famine.
Then Geneviève took command of the boats which were sent
up stream to Troyes for succour, stilled by her prayers the
frequent tempests, and brought the ships back laden with provisions.
After the Franks had captured Paris, Ste. Geneviève
carried on Roman traditions into the Frankish court; she was
instrumental in converting Clovis and his wife Clotilde; and
when she died, at eighty-nine, a natural death, she was buried
by the side of her illustrious disciples. The history of her body
will be given at length when we come to examine her church on
the South Side, commonly called the Panthéon; but her image
may frequently be recognised on early buildings by the figure
of a devil at her side, endeavouring in vain (as was his wont) to
extinguish her lighted taper—the taper, no doubt, of Roman
Christianity, which she did not allow to be quenched by the
Frankish invaders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Round these two sacred personages the whole art and history
of early Paris continually cluster. The beautiful figure of the
simple peasant enthusiast, Ste. Geneviève, in particular, has
largely coloured Parisian ideas and Parisian sympathies. Her
shrine still attracts countless thousands of the faithful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having premised these facts, we are now in a position to
commence our survey of the city. I strongly recommend the
reader to visit the various objects of interest in the exact order
here prescribed. Otherwise, he will not understand the various
allusions to points already elucidated. But no necessary
organic connection exists between the <span class='bold'>collections of the
Louvre</span> and the town in which they are housed. Therefore,
they may be visited off and on at any time (see Introduction to
the Collections in Part III). <span class='bold'>Utilize rainy days in the
Galleries of the Louvre.</span></p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span><h1 id='ch1'><span style='font-size:smaller'>I</span><br/> THE ÎLE DE LA CITÉ</h1></div>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>[T</span></span>HE Île de la Cité, the oldest Paris, consisted in the
Middle Ages of a labyrinth of narrow and tortuous
lanes, now entirely replaced by large and stately modern
official buildings. In Roman and Frankish times, it comprised
the whole of the town, save a small suburb extending
as far as the present Museum of Cluny, on the South
Side. Among its sunless alleys, however, in later mediæval
days, numerous churches raised their heads, of which
<span class='bold'>Notre-Dame</span> and the <span class='bold'>Sainte Chapelle</span> alone now remain;
while others, dedicated to the oldest local saints, such as Ste.
Geneviève-des-Ardents, St. Éloy, and St. Germain-le-Vieux, have
been entirely destroyed. The west extremity of the island was
formerly occupied by the old <span class='bold'>Royal Palace</span>, parts of which
still survive, included in the buildings of the modern <span class='bold'>Palais de
Justice</span>. On the east end stood the cathedral of Notre-Dame,
with the episcopal palace in its rear; while, close by, rose the
earliest hospital in Europe, the Hôtel-Dieu, said to have been
originally founded by Clovis, and now represented by a vastly
larger modern building on a different site. As the burgesses
began to shift their homes to the quarters north of the Seine, in
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the Cité was gradually
given over to the clergy. The kings also removed from the
Palace of the Capets to their new residences on the North Bank
(Bastille, Hôtel Saint-Paul, old castle of the Louvre), and gave
up their island mansion to the Parlement or Supreme Court,
since which time it has been commonly known as the <span class='bold'>Palais
de Justice</span>, and extensively modernised. At the present day,
the Cité has become the head-quarters of Law, Police, and
Religion, and is almost entirely occupied by huge official structures,
which cover enormous areas, and largely conceal its
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>
primitive character. It still contains, however, the most precious
mediæval monuments of Paris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At least <span class='bold'>two days</span> should be devoted to the Île de la Cité;
one to the Palace and the Sainte Chapelle, another to the
Cathedral. Do not attempt to see them both together.]</p>

</div>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='ch1a'>A. THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE AND THE<br/> SAINTE CHAPELLE</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Go along the Rue de Rivoli as far as the Square of the Tour
St. Jacques. If driving, alight here. Turn down the Place du
Châtelet to your right. In front is the pretty modern fountain
of the Châtelet: right, the Théâtre du Châtelet; left, the Opéra
Comique. The bridge which faces you is the Pont-au-Change,
so-called from the money-changers’ and jewellers’ booths which
once flanked its wooden predecessor (the oldest in Paris), as
they still do the Rialto at Venice, and the Ponte Vecchio at
Florence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stand by the right-hand corner of the bridge before
crossing it. In front is the Île de la Cité. The square, dome-crowned
building opposite you to the left is the modern Tribunal
de Commerce; beyond it leftward lie the Marché-aux-Fleurs
and the long line of the Hôtel-Dieu, above which rise the
towers and spire of Notre-Dame. In front, to the right, the
vast block of buildings broken by towers forms part of the
Palais de Justice, the ancient <span class='bold'>Palace of the French kings</span>,
begun by Hugues Capet. The square tower to the left in this
block is the Tour de l’Horloge. Next, to the right, come the
two round towers of the Conciergerie, known respectively as
the Tour de César and the Tour de Montgomery. The one
beyond them, with battlements, is the Tour d’Argent. It was
in the Conciergerie that Marie Antoinette, Robespierre, and
many other victims of the Revolution were imprisoned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These mediæval towers, much altered and modernized, are
now almost all that remains of the old Palace, which, till after
the reign of Louis IX (St. Louis), formed the residence of the
Kings of France. Charles VII gave it in 1431 to the Parlement
or Supreme Court. Ruined by fires and rebuilding, it
now consists for the most part of masses of irregular recent
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>
edifices. The main modern façade fronts the Boulevard
du Palais.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cross the bridge. The Tour de l’Horloge on your right, at
the corner of the Boulevard du Palais, contains the oldest
public clock in France (1370). The figures of Justice and Piety
by its side were originally designed by Germain Pilon, but are
now replaced by copies. Walk round the Palais by the quay
along the north branch of the Seine till you come to the Rue de
Harlay. Turn there to your left, towards the handsome and
imposing modern façade of this side of the Palais de Justice.
The interior is unworthy a visit. The Rue de Harlay forms the
westernmost end of the original Île de la Cité. The prow-shaped
extremity of the modern island has been artificially
produced by embanking the sites of two or three minor islets.
The Place Dauphine, which occupies the greater part of this
modern extension, was built in 1608; it still affords a characteristic
example of the domestic Paris of the period before Baron
Haussmann. Continue along the quay as far as the Pont-Neuf,
so as to gain an idea of the extent of the Île de la Cité in this
direction. The centre of the Pont-Neuf is occupied by an
equestrian statue of Henri IV, first of the Bourbon kings. Its
predecessor was erected in 1635, and was destroyed to make
cannon during the great Revolution. Louis XVIII re-erected
it. From this point you can gain a clear idea of the two
branches of the Seine as they unite at the lower end of the Île
de la Cité. To your right, looking westward, you also obtain a
fine view of the Colonnade of the Old Louvre, with the southwestern
gallery, and the more modern buildings of the Museum
behind it. (See later.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, walk along the southern quay of the island, round the
remainder of the Palais de Justice, as far as the Boulevard du
Palais. There turn to your left, and go in at the first door of
the Palace on the left (undeterred by sentries) into the court of
<span class='bold'>the Sainte Chapelle</span>, the only important relic now remaining
of the home of Saint Louis. You may safely neglect the
remainder of the building.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>[The thirteenth century (age of the Crusades) was a period of
profound religious enthusiasm throughout Europe. Conspicuous
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>
among its devout soldiers was Louis IX, afterwards
canonized as <span class='bold'>St. Louis</span>. The saintly king purchased from
Baldwin, Emperor of Constantinople, the veritable <span class='bold'>Crown of
Thorns</span>, and a fragment of the <span class='bold'>True Cross</span>—paying for these
relics an immense sum of money. Having become possessed
of such invaluable and sacred objects, Louis desired to have
them housed with suitable magnificence. He therefore entrusted
one Pierre de Montereau with the task of building a
splendid chapel (within the precincts of his palace), begun in
1245, and finished three years later, immediately after which
the king set out on his Crusade. The monument thus breathes
throughout the ecstatic piety of the mystic king; it was consecrated
in 1248, in the name of the Holy Crown and the Holy
Cross, by Eudes de Châteauroux, Bishop of Tusculum and
papal legate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three things should be noted about the Sainte Chapelle.
(1) It is a <span class='bold'>chapel</span>, not a church; therefore it consists (practically)
of a choir alone, without nave or transepts. (2) It is the
<span class='bold'>domestic Chapel of the Royal Palace</span>. (3) It is, above all
things, the <span class='bold'>Shrine of the Crown of Thorns</span>. These three
points must be constantly borne in mind in examining the
building.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Erected later than Notre-Dame, it represents the pointed
style of the middle of the thirteenth century, and is singularly
pure and uniform throughout. Secularized at the Revolution,
it fell somewhat into decay; but was judiciously restored by
Viollet-le-Duc and others. The “Messe Rouge,” or “Messe du
St. Esprit,” is still celebrated here once yearly, on the re-opening
of the courts after the autumn vacation, but no other
religious services take place in the building. The Crown of
Thorns and the piece of the True Cross are now preserved
in the Treasury at Notre-Dame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Open daily, free, except Mondays, 11 to 4 or 5. Choose
<span class='bold'>a very bright day</span> to visit it.]</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Examine the <span class='bold'>exterior</span> in detail from the court on the south
side. More even than most Gothic buildings, the Sainte
Chapelle is supported entirely by its massive piers, the wall
being merely used for enclosure, and consisting for the most
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>
part of lofty windows. As in most French Gothic buildings,
the choir terminates in a round apse, whereas English cathedrals
have usually a square end. The beautiful light <span class='bold'>flèche</span>
or spire in the centre has been restored. Observe the graceful
leaden angel, holding a cross, on the summit of the <span class='it'>chevet</span> or
round apse. To see <span class='bold'>the façade</span>, stand well back opposite it,
when you can observe that the chapel is built in four main
stories,—those, namely, of the Lower Church or crypt, of the
Upper Church, of the great rose window (with later flamboyant
tracery), and of the gable-end, partially masked by an open
parapet studded with the royal fleurs-de-lis of France. The
Crown of Thorns surrounds the two pinnacles which flank the
fourth story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chapel consists of a lower and an upper church. The
<span class='bold'>Lower Church</span> is a mere crypt, which was employed for the
servants of the royal family. Its portal has in its tympanum (or
triangular space in the summit of the arch) the Coronation of
the Virgin, and on its centre pillar a good figure of the Madonna
and Child. Enter the Lower Church. It is low, and has pillars
supporting the floor above. In the polychromatic decoration of
the walls and pillars, notice the frequent repetition of the royal
lilies of France, combined with the three castles of Castille, in
honour of Blanche of Castille, the mother of St. Louis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mount to <span class='bold'>**the Upper Chapel</span> (or Sainte Chapelle proper) by
the small spiral staircase in the corner. This soaring pile was
the oratory where the royal family and court attended service;
its gorgeousness bespeaks its origin and nature. It glows like a
jewel. First go out of the door and examine the <span class='bold'>exterior and
doorway</span> of the chapel. Its platform was directly approached
in early times from the Palace. The centre pillar bears a
fine figure of Christ. In the tympanum (as over the principal
doorway of almost every important church in Paris and the
district) is a relief of the Last Judgment. Below stands St.
Michael with his scales, weighing the souls; on either side
is depicted the Resurrection, with the Angels of the Last Trump.
Above, in the second tier, is Christ, holding up His hands with
the marks of the nails, as a sign of mercy to the redeemed: to
<span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> and <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> of Him angels display the Crown of Thorns and the
True Cross, to contain which sacred relics the chapel was built.
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>
Extreme <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> kneels the Blessed Virgin; extreme <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, Sainte
Geneviève. This scene of the Last Judgment was adapted with
a few alterations from that above the central west door of Notre-Dame,
the Crown of Thorns in particular being here significantly
substituted for the three nails and spear. The small
lozenge reliefs to <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> and <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> of the portal are also interesting.
Those to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> represent in a very naïve manner God the
Father creating the world, sun and moon, light, plants, animals,
man, etc. Those to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> give the story of Genesis, Cain and
Abel, the Flood, the Ark, Noah’s Sacrifice, Noah’s Vine, etc.
the subjects of all which the visitor can easily recognise, and is
strongly recommended to identify for himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>interior</span> consists almost entirely of large and lofty windows,
with magnificent stained glass, in large part ancient. The
piers which divide the windows and alone support the graceful
vault of the roof, are provided with statues of the twelve
apostles, a few of them original. Each bears his well-known
symbol. Spell them out if possible. Beneath the windows, in
the quatrefoils of the arcade, are enamelled glass mosaics representing
the martyrdoms of the saints—followers of Christ, each
wearing his own crown of thorns: a pretty conceit wholly in
accord with St. Louis’s ecstatic type of piety. Conspicuous
among them are St. Denis carrying his head, St. Sebastian
pierced with arrows, St. Stephen stoned, St. Lawrence on his
gridiron, etc. Examine and identify each separately. The apse
(formerly separated from the body of the building by a rood-screen,
now destroyed) contains the vacant base of the high
altar, behind which stands an arcaded tabernacle, now empty,
in whose shrine were once preserved the Crown of Thorns, the
fragment of the True Cross, and other relics. Amongst them in
later times was included the skull of St. Louis himself in a
golden reliquary. Two angels at the summit of the large centre
arch of the arcade bear a representation of the Crown of Thorns
in their hands. Above the tabernacle rises a canopy or baldacchino,
approached by two spiral staircases; from its platform
St. Louis and his successors, the kings of France, were in the
habit of exhibiting with their own hands the actual relics themselves
once a year to the faithful. The golden reliquary in
which the sacred objects were contained was melted down in the
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>
Revolution. The small window with bars to your <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, as you
face the high altar, was placed there by the superstitious and
timid Louis XI, in order that he might behold the elevation of
the Host and the sacred relics without being exposed to the
danger of assassination. The visitor should also notice the
inlaid stone pavement, with its frequent repetition of the fleur-de-lis
and the three castles. The whole breathes the mysticism
of St. Louis: the lightness of the architecture, the height of the
apparently unsupported roof, and the magnificence of the decoration,
render this the most perfect ecclesiastical building in
Paris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In returning from the chapel, notice on the outside, from the
court to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>S.</span>, the apparently empty and useless porch, supporting
a small room, which is the one through whose grated
window Louis XI used to watch the elevation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would recommend the visitor on his way home from this
excursion to walk round the remainder of the Île de la Cité in
the direction of Notre-Dame, so as to gain a clear idea of the
extent of the island, without, however, endeavouring to examine
the cathedral in detail on this occasion.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='ch1b'>B. NOTRE-DAME</h2>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>[In very early times, under the Frankish monarchs, the principal
church of Paris was dedicated to <span class='bold'>St. Stephen the Protomartyr</span>.
It stood on part of the site now covered by Notre-Dame,
and was always enumerated first among the churches of
the city. A smaller edifice, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin
Mary, also occupied a part of the site of the existing cathedral.
About the middle of the twelfth century, however, it was resolved
to erect a much larger cathedral on the Île de la Cité,
suitable for the capital of so important a country as France had
become under Louis VI and Louis VII; and since the cult of
the Blessed Virgin had then long been increasing, it was also
decided to dedicate the new building to Our Lady alone, to the
exclusion of St. Stephen. The two early churches were therefore
cleared away by degrees, and in 1163 the work of erecting
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>
the present church was begun under Bishop Maurice de Sully,
the first stone being laid by Pope Alexander III, in person.
The relics of St. Stephen were reverently conveyed to a new
church erected in his honour on the hill of Ste. Geneviève, south
of the river (now represented by St. Étienne-du-Mont, to be
described hereafter), and Our Lady was left in sole possession
of the episcopal edifice. Nevertheless, it would seem that the
builders feared to excite the enmity of so powerful a saint as
the Protomartyr; for many <span class='bold'>memorials of St. Stephen</span> remain
to this day in the existing cathedral, and will be pointed out
during the course of our separate survey.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Notre-Dame de Paris</span> is an edifice in the <span class='bold'>Early French
Gothic style</span>, the first great church in that style to be erected
in France, and the model on which many others were afterwards
based. Begun in 1163, it was consecrated in 1182, but
the western front was not commenced till 1218, and the nave
was only finished towards the middle of the 13th century.
Much desecrated in the Revolution, the cathedral has been on
the whole admirably restored. It stands at present lower than
it once did, owing to the gradual rise of the surrounding
ground; formerly, it was approached by thirteen steps (the
regulation number, imitated from the Temple at Jerusalem).
It has <span class='bold'>two western towers</span>, instead of one in the centre where
nave and transepts intersect, as is usual in England; so have
all the cathedrals in France which imitate it. This peculiarity
is due to the fact that French Gothic <span class='bold'>aims</span> especially <span class='bold'>at height</span>,
and, the nave being raised so very high, a tower could not
safely be added above it. Other differences between English
and French Gothic will be pointed out in detail in the course
of our survey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though Notre-Dame was the first great building in Paris
proper, it must be borne in mind that the magnificent Basilica
of St. Denis, four miles to the north, and also the Abbey
Church of St. Germain-des-Prés, in the southern suburb, antedated
it by several years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Recollect three things about Notre-Dame. (1) It is <span class='bold'>a church
of Our Lady</span>: therefore, most of it bears reference to her cult
and legends. (2) It is the <span class='bold'>cathedral church of Paris</span>: therefore,
it is full of memorials of local saints—St. Denis, Ste.
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>
Geneviève, St. Marcel, Bishop of Paris, etc., amongst whom
must also be classed St. Stephen. (3) It is <span class='bold'>a royal church</span>:
therefore it contains many reminders of the close alliance of
Church and State. Thus understood, Notre-Dame becomes an
epic in stone.</p>

</div>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Go along the Rue de Rivoli as far as the Square of the Tour
St. Jacques. Walk through the little garden. Notice, in passing,
<span class='bold'>*</span>the tower—all that now remains of the church of St.
Jacques-de-la-Boucherie—used at present as a meteorological
observatory. Turn down the Rue St. Martin to the Pont Notre-Dame.
In front, <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, stands the Hôtel-Dieu; <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, the Tribunal de
Commerce; centre, the Marché-aux-Fleurs; at its back, the
Prefecture de Police. Continue straight along the Rue de la
Cité, passing, <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, the main <span class='it'>façade</span> of the modern Palais de
Justice (with a glimpse of the Ste. Chapelle) till you come to
the broad and open Place Notre-Dame (generally known by its
mediæval name of the Parvis). Take a seat under the horse-chestnuts
on the north side of the Place, opposite the equestrian
statue of Charlemagne, in order to examine the <span class='bold'>façade</span> of the
cathedral.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>**west front</span>, dating from the beginning of the 13th
century (later than the rest), consists of two stories, flanked by
towers of four stories. The <span class='it'>first</span> story contains the three main
portals: <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, the door of Our Lady; centre, of her Son; <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, of her
Mother. On the buttresses between them stand four statues:
extreme <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, St. Stephen; extreme <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, St. Marcel, Bishop of Paris
(a canonized holder of this very see); centre <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, the Church,
triumphant; centre <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, the Synagogue, dejected (representing
between them the Law and the Gospel). This first story is
crowned and terminated by the Galerie des Rois, containing
figures of the kings of Israel and Judah, ancestors of the
Blessed Virgin (others say, kings of France to the date of the
building), destroyed in the great Revolution, but since restored.
On the parapet above it stand, <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> and <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, Adam and Eve;
centre, Our Lady and Child with two adoring angels—the Fall
and the Redemption. The <span class='it'>second</span> story contains the great rose
window and two side-arches with double windows. The <span class='it'>third</span>
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>
story of the towers consists of a graceful open-work screen,
continued in front of the nave, so as to hide its ugly gable
(which is visible from further back in the Place), thus giving
the main front a fallacious appearance of having three stories.
The final or <span class='it'>fourth</span> story of the towers is pierced on each side
by two gigantic windows, adding lightness to their otherwise
massive block. The contemplated spires have never been
added. This <span class='it'>façade</span> has been copied with modifications in
many other French cathedrals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now approach the front, to examine in detail the <span class='bold'>**great
portals</span>, deeply recessed, as is usual in French cathedrals, owing
to the massive masonry of the towers. The left or <span class='it'>northern</span>
doorway—that of <span class='bold'>Our Lady</span> (by which her church is usually
entered) bears on its central pier a statue of the Virgin and
Child; beneath her feet are scenes from the temptation of Eve,
who brought into the world sin, and the first murderer Cain, as
contrasted with her descendant, the Blessed Virgin, who
brought into the world the Redeemer of mankind. Over Our
Lady’s head, a tabernacle, representing the relics preserved
within. In the tympanum, first tier, <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, three patriarchs; <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>,
three kings, typifying the ancestors of the Blessed Virgin.
Above, second tier, the Entombment of the Virgin, placed in
her sarcophagus by angels, and attended by the apostles with
their familiar symbols. Higher still, third tier, the Coronation
of the Virgin, in the presence of her Son, with adoring angels.
The whole thus represents the Glory of Our Lady. At the
sides below, life-size figures; extreme <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, Constantine, first
Christian Emperor; extreme <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, Pope Silvester, to whom he is
supposed to have given the patrimony of St. Peter—the two
representing the union of Church and State. Next to these the
great local saints: <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, St. Denis, bearing his head, and guided
by two angels; <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, St. John Baptist, St. Stephen, and Ste. Geneviève,
with the devil endeavouring to extinguish her taper, and
a sympathizing angel. The figures on the arch represent spectators
of the Coronation of the Virgin. Minor subjects—signs
of the Zodiac, Months, etc.—I leave to the ingenuity and skill
of the reader. The <span class='bold'>*</span><span class='it'>centre</span> doorway (commonly called the
Porte du Jugement) is that of the Redeemer, <span class='bold'>Our Lady’s Son</span>;
on its central pier, fine modern figure of Christ blessing; above,
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>
in the tympanum, the usual Last Judgment. First tier (modern)
the General Resurrection, with angels of the last trump, and
kings, queens, bishops, knights, etc., rising from their tombs;
conspicuous among them is naturally St. Stephen. Second tier,
St. Michael the Archangel weighing souls, with devils and angels
in waiting, the devils cheating; <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, the wicked (on Christ’s left)
hauled in chains to hell; <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, the saints (on His right) ascending
to glory. On the summit, third tier, the New Jerusalem, with
Christ enthroned, showing His wounds in mercy, flanked by
adoring angels holding the cross, spear, and nails; <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, the
Blessed Virgin, patroness of this church; and <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, Ste. Geneviève,
patroness of Paris, interceding for their votaries. (Last figure is
usually, but I think incorrectly, identified as St. John the Evangelist,
who has no function on a Parisian Cathedral.) This
relief, closely copied at the Ste. Chapelle, is itself imitated from
one at St. Denis. On the lintels the Wise (<span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>) and Foolish (<span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>)
Virgins; <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> and <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> on jambs, life-size figures of the Twelve Apostles,
with their usual symbols. Observe the beautiful ironwork of
the hinges. The third or <span class='it'>southern</span> portal, that of St. Anne—the
<span class='bold'>Mother of the Virgin</span>—contains older work than the other
two, replaced from the earlier church on the same site. The
style of the figures is therefore Romanesque, not Gothic; so is
the architecture represented in them. On the centre pier, St.
Marcel, Bishop of Paris. Above, tympanum, history of St.
Anne; first tier, centre, the meeting of Joachim and Anna at the
Golden Gate; <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, Marriage of the Virgin; <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, her Presentation by
St. Anne in the Temple, etc. Second tier, the Nativity, and the
visit of the Magi to Herod; at the summit, third tier, Madonna
enthroned, with adoring angels, a king, and a bishop—Church
and State once more identified. The work on this doorway
much resembles that at St. Denis. Magnificent iron hinges,
brought from old St. Stephen’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Walk round the quay on the South side to examine <span class='bold'>the body
of the church</span>. Notice the lofty Nave, and almost equally
lofty Aisles, with (later) side-chapels built out as far as the level
of the Transept; also, the flying buttresses. As in most French
churches, the transepts are short, and project but little from
the aisles. The South Transept has a good late <span class='it'>façade</span> with
two rose-windows. Its portal—ill visible—is dedicated (in
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>
compensation) to the displaced St. Stephen, and contains on
the pier a figure of the saint, robed, as usual, as a deacon; in
the tympanum are reliefs of his preaching, martyrdom, death,
and glorification. Note, to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, a small relief of St. Martin
of Tours dividing his cloak with the beggar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Enter the little garden further east, which occupies the site
of the former archevêché, in order to observe the characteristic
French form of the <span class='bold'>choir</span>—a lofty and narrow apse, with
apsidal aisles and circular chapels added below, the whole
forming what is called a <span class='it'>chevet</span>. The light flying buttresses
which support the soaring and slender choir add greatly to the
beauty and picturesqueness of the building. Pretty modern
Gothic fountain. Quit the garden and continue round the
Northern side of the Cathedral. The first (small) door at which
we arrive—the Porte Rouge—admits the canons. It is a late
addition, built in 1407 by Jean sans Peur, Duke of Burgundy,
in expiation of his murder of the Duke of Orleans; the donor
and his wife kneel on each side of the Coronation of the Virgin
in the tympanum. Notice here the gargoyles and the graceful
architecture of the supports to the buttresses. The second
(larger) door—the Portail du Cloître, so called from the cloisters
long demolished—in the North Transept contains a good
statue of the Madonna on the pier; above, in the tympanum,
confused figures tell obscurely the legend of the monk Theophilus,
who sold his soul to the devil. Stand opposite this
door, on the far pavement, to observe the architecture of the
North Transept. The best point of view for the whole body of
the cathedral, as distinct from the <span class='it'>façade</span>, can be obtained from
the Quai de Montebello on the south side of the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To visit the <span class='bold'>interior</span>, enter by the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, or northern door of the
<span class='it'>façade</span>—that of Our Lady. The lofty nave is flanked by double
aisles, all supported by powerful piers. Walk across the church
and notice all five vistas. Observe the height and the delicate
arches of the triforium, or pierced gallery of the second story, as
well as the windows of the clerestory above it—the part of the
nave which rises higher than the aisles, and opens freely to the
exterior. Walk down the outer <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> aisle. The side-chapels,
each dedicated to a separate saint, contain the altars and
statues of their patrons. Notice the shortness of the Transepts,
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>
with their great rose windows; observe also the vaulting of
the roof, especially at the intersection of the four main arms of
the building. The entrance to the <span class='bold'>choir</span> and <span class='bold'>ambulatory</span> is in
the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> or <span style='font-size:smaller'>S</span> Transept. Close by, near the pillar, Notre-Dame
de Paris, <span class='it'>the</span> wonder-working mediæval statue of Our Lady.
The double aisles are continued round the choir, which is
separated from them by a wall and gateways. Approach the
brass grills, in order to inspect the interior of the choir, whose
furniture was largely modernised and ruined by Louis XIV, in
accordance with a misguided vow of his father. Chapels surround
the ambulatory, many of them with good glass windows
and tolerable frescoes. The chapel at the end is that of Our
Lady of the Seven Sorrows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By far the most interesting object in the interior, however, is
the series of <span class='bold'>**high reliefs in stone</span>, gilt and painted (on the
wall between choir and ambulatory), executed early in the 14th
century by Jehan Ravy and his nephew, Jehan de Bouteillier,
which, though inferior in merit to those in the same position in
Amiens cathedral, are admirable examples of animated and
vigorous French sculpture of their period. The series begins
on the <span style='font-size:smaller'>N</span> side of the choir, at the point most remote from the
grill which leads to the Transept. The remaining subjects (for
some, like the Annunciation, are destroyed) comprise the
Visitation; Adoration of the Shepherds; Nativity; Adoration of
the Magi (note the Three Kings, representing the three ages of
man; the oldest, as usual, has removed his crown, and is offering
his gift); the Massacre of the Innocents; the Flight into
Egypt (where a grotesque little temple, containing two odd
small gods, quaintly represents the prevalence of idolatry);
the Presentation in the Temple; Christ among the Doctors;
the Baptism in Jordan (with attendant angel holding a towel);
the Miracle at Cana; the Entry into Jerusalem (with Zacchæus
in the tree, and the gate of the city); the Last Supper; the
Washing of the Apostles’ feet; and the Agony in the Garden.
The tourist should carefully examine all these subjects, the
treatment of which strikes a keynote. Similar scenes, almost
identical in their figures, will be found in abundance at Cluny
and elsewhere. Note, for example, the symbolical Jordan in
the Baptism, with St. John pouring water from a cup, and the
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>
attendant angel, all of which we shall often recognise hereafter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The series is continued on the other (<span style='font-size:smaller'>S</span>) side of the choir (a
little later in date, with names in Latin underneath; better
modelled, but neither so quaint nor so vigorous). The subjects
begin by the grill of the South Transept, with the “Noli me
tangere” or Apparition to Mary Magdalen (Christ as a gardener);
the Apparition to the Marys; to Simon Peter; to the
Disciples at Emmaus (dressed as mediæval pilgrims); to the
Eleven Apostles; to the Ten and Thomas; to the Eleven by
the sea of Tiberias; to the Disciples in Galilee; and on the
Mount of Olives. The intervening and remaining subjects—Scourging,
Crucifixion, Ascension, etc.—were ruthlessly destroyed
by Louis XIV, in order to carry out his supposed improvements
in accordance with the vow of his father, Louis
XIII. The woodwork of the choir-stalls, executed by his
order, is celebrated, and uninteresting. You may omit it.
The Treasury contains little of artistic value. The Crown of
Thorns still figures in its inventory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leave the Choir by the door by which you entered it, and
seat yourself for a while at the intersection of the Nave and
Transepts, in order to gain a good idea of the Apse, the Choir,
and the general arrangement of the shortly cruciform building.
Observe the beautiful vaulting of the roof, and the extent to
which the church is born on its piers alone, the intervening
walls (pierced by windows and triforium-arches) being intended
merely for purposes of enclosure. Note also the fine ancient
glass of the rose windows. Quit the church by the North or
Left Aisle, and come back to it often.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those who are not afraid of a spiral staircase, mostly well
lighted, should <span class='bold'>ascend</span> the Left or <span class='bold'>North Tower</span> (tickets fifty
cents. each, at the base of the tower). Stop near the top to
inspect the gallery, with the famous birds and demons. The
view hence embraces from the front the Tower of St. Jacques; behind
it, the hill of Montmartre, with the white turrets and cupolas
of the church of the Sacré-Cœur; a little to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, St. Eustache;
then the Tribunal de Commerce; St. Augustin; the Louvre;
the roof of the Ste. Chapelle; the Arc de Triomphe; the twin
towers of the Trocadéro; the Eiffel Tower; the gilded dome of
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>
the Invalides; St. Sulpice, etc. The Île de la Cité is well seen
hence as an island. Note also the gigantic size of the open
screen, which looked so small from below. Ascend to the top.
Good general panorama of the town and valley. This is the
best total view of Paris, far superior to that from the Eiffel
Tower, being so much more central.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Return by the Pont d’Arcole (whence you get a capital notion
of the bifurcation of the Seine around the Île St. Louis), and
then pass the modern Hôtel-de-Ville, with St. Gervais behind
it, on your way home to the Rue de Rivoli.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='ch1c'>MAP OF HISTORIC PARIS.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>This Map represents approximately the growth of Paris, outside
the island, at different epochs. Earlier buildings are printed
in black; later streets and edifices are shown by means of dotted
lines. But the Map does</span> <span class='bold'>not</span> <span class='it'>represent the aspect of Paris at
any one time; it merely illustrates this Guide: thus, the original
Château of the Louvre is marked in black; the later Palace is
dotted; whereas the Madeleine, a much more modern building
than the Louvre of François I, is again inserted in black, because
it does not interfere with the site of any more ancient
building. In very early times the town spread south as far only
as Cluny, and north (just opposite the island) as far as the Rue
de Rivoli. The subsequent</span> <span class='bold'>walls</span> <span class='it'>are marked approximately on
the Map, with the chief edifices enclosed by them. The fortifications
of Louis XIII were demolished by Louis XIV, who substituted
for them the broad streets still known as the</span> <span class='bold'>Boulevards</span>.
<span class='it'>This Map shows, roughly speaking, the extent of Paris under
Louis XIV; by comparing it with Baedeker’s Map of Modern
Paris, the small relative size of the 17th-century town will be at
once appreciated. Nevertheless, the inner nucleus here mapped
out contains almost everything worthy of note in the existing
city.</span></p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span><h1 id='ch2'><span style='font-size:smaller'>II</span><br/> THE LEFT OR SOUTH BANK</h1></div>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>[T</span></span>HE earliest <span class='bold'>overflow</span> of Paris was from the Île de la
Cité to the <span class='bold'>Left</span> or <span class='bold'>South Bank</span> (<span class='it'>Rive Gauche</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reason for this overflow is clear. The city was situated
on a small island, near the head of navigation; it guarded
the passage of the Seine by the double bridge. Naturally,
however, at a time when all civilization lay to the south, as
the town began to grow, it spread southward, towards Rome,
Lyons, Marseilles, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Arles, Nîmes, and
the Roman culture. To the north at that time lay nothing
but comparative barbarism—the Britons and the Germans;
or later, the English, the Normans, and the Teutonic hordes.
Hence, from a very early date, Paris first <span class='bold'>ran southward</span>
along the road to Rome. Already in Roman times, here
stood the palace of Constantius Chlorus and Julian, now the
Thermes—the fortress which formed the <span class='it'>tête du pont</span> for the
city. Later, the southern suburb became the seat of learning
and law; it was known by the name which it still in part
retains of the Université, but is oftener now called the <span class='it'>Quartier
Latin</span>. At first, however, only a small portion of the Left Bank
was built over. But gradually the area of the new town spread
from the immediate neighbourhood of the old Hôtel-Dieu, with
its church or chapel of St. Julien-le-Pauvre, to the modern limit
of the Boulevard St. Germain; and thence again, by the time
of Louis Quatorze, to the further Boulevards just south of the
Luxembourg. It is interesting to note, too, that all this
southern side, long known as the Université, still retains its
position as the learned district. Not only does it include the
students’ region—the Quartier Latin—with many of the chief
artistic studios, but it embraces in particular the Sorbonne, or
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>
University, the Institute of France, with its various branches
(Académie Française, Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres,
Académie des Sciences, des Beaux-Arts, etc.), the
École des Beaux-Arts, the École de Médicine, the Collège de
France, the Lycées St. Louis, Louis-le-Grand, and Henri IV,
the École Polytechnique, the École des Mines, the Bibliothèque
Ste. Geneviève, the Jardin des Plantes, and the Luxembourg
Museum of Modern Paintings. In short, the Left Bank represents
literary, scientific, artistic, and educational Paris—the
students in law, arts, and medicine, with their own subventioned
theatre, the Odéon, and their libraries, schools, laboratories, and
<span class='it'>cafés</span>. It is further noticeable that these institutions cluster
thickest round the older part of the southern suburb, just opposite
the Cité, while almost all of them lie within the limits of the
outer boulevards of Louis XIV.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Quartier Latin</span> surrounds the Sorbonne, and is traversed
by the modern Boulevard St. Michel. The <span class='bold'>Faubourg St.
Germain</span>, immediately to the west of it (surrounding the old
Abbey of St. Germain-des-Prés) is of rather later date; it
owes its origin in large part to the Renaissance spirit, and
especially to Marie de Médicis’ palace of the Luxembourg. It is
still the residence of many of the old nobility, and is regarded
as the distinctively aristocratic quarter of Paris, in the restricted
sense, while the district lying around the Champs Élysées is
rather plutocratic and modern than noble in the older signification
of the word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The visitor will therefore bear in mind distinctly that the
<span class='bold'>South Side</span> is <span class='bold'>the Paris of the Students</span>.]</p>

</div>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='ch2a'>A. THE ROMAN PALACE AND THE<br/> MUSÉE DE CLUNY</h2>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>[The primitive nucleus of the suburb on the South Side consists
of the <span class='bold'>Roman fortress palace</span>, the <span class='it'>tête du pont</span> of the
Left Bank, now known as the Thermes, owing to the fact that
its principal existing remains include only the ruins of the baths
or <span class='it'>thermæ</span>. This colossal building, probably erected by Constantius
Chlorus, the father of Constantine, covered an enormous
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>
area south of the river. After the Frankish conquest, it still
remained the residence of the Merwing and Karling kings on
the rare occasions when they visited Paris; and it does not
seem to have fallen into utter decay till a comparatively late
date in the Middle Ages. With the Norman irruptions, however,
and the rise of the real French monarchs under Eudes
and the Capets, the new sovereigns found it safest to transfer
their seat to the Palace on the Island (now the Palais de Justice),
and the Roman fortress was gradually dismantled. In 1340
the gigantic ruins came into the hands of the powerful Benedictine
Abbey of Cluny, near Mâcon, in Burgundy; and about
1480, the abbots began to erect on the spot <span class='bold'>a town mansion</span>
for themselves, which still bears the name of the <span class='bold'>Hôtel de
Cluny</span>. The letter K, the mark of Charles VIII (1483–1498),
occurs on many parts of the existing building, and fixes its
epoch. The house was mostly built by Jacques d’Amboise,
abbot, in 1490. The style is late Gothic, with Renaissance
features. The abbots, however, seldom visited Paris, and they
frequently placed their town house accordingly at the disposition
of the kings of France. Mary of England, sister of Henry
VIII, and widow of Louis XII, occupied it thus in 1515, soon
after its completion. It was usual for the queens of France to
wear white as mourning; hence her apartment is still known
as the <span class='it'>Chambre de la reine blanche</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the Revolution, when the property of the monasteries was
confiscated, the Hôtel de Cluny was sold, and passed at last, in
1833, into the hands of M. du Sommerard, a zealous antiquary,
who began the priceless collection of works of art which it
contains. He died in 1842, and the Government then bought
the house and museum, and united it with the Roman ruin at
its back under the title of <span class='it'>Musée des Thermes et de l’Hôtel de
Cluny</span>. Since that time many further objects have been added
to the collection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Cluny the actual building forms one of the most interesting
parts of the sight, and is in itself a museum. It is a charming
specimen of a late mediæval French mansion; and the works
of art it contains are of the highest artistic value. I am able
briefly to describe only what seem to me the most important out
of its many thousands of beautiful exhibits. At least two whole
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>
days should be devoted to Cluny—one to the lower and one to
the upper floor. Much more, if possible.]</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Go to the Place du Châtelet; cross the bridge, and the Île
de la Cité; also, the Pont St. Michel to the South Side.
Good view of Notre-Dame to <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>. In front lies the modern
Boulevard St. Michel, with the Fontaine St. Michel in the
foreground (statue by Duret). Continue along the Boulevard
till you reach the Boulevard St. Germain, another great modern
thoroughfare which cuts right through the streets of the old
Faubourg and the narrow alleys of the Latin Quarter. The
Garden at the corner contains all that remains of the Roman
Palace. Notice its solid masonry as you pass. Then, take
the first turn to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, the Rue du Sommerard, which leads
you at once to the door of the <span class='bold'>Museum</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Notice the late semi-Gothic <span class='bold'>Gateway</span>, resembling that of an
Oxford college. Pass through the flat-arched gate into the
handsome courtyard. To the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> is a late Gothic <span class='it'>loggia</span>, containing
a few antiques. In front stands the main building, with
square windows and high dormers, bearing the staff and pilgrim’s
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>
scallop, the symbol of St. James, with the cardinal’s hat and
scutcheons and devices of the family d’Amboise, thus indicating
the name of Jacques d’Amboise, the abbot who built
it. Entrance to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>. Open free, daily, 11 to 4 or 5, except
Mondays.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first suite of rooms which we enter form some of the
apartments of the original building. Observe the fine timbered
<span class='bold'>ceilings</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Room I.—Panels, etc., in wood-carving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Room II.—<span class='bold'>*</span>Fine French chimney-piece, by Hugues Lallement,
dated 1562, representing Christ and the Woman of
Samaria at the well, brought from a house at Châlons-sur-Marne.
<span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> and <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> of entrance (<span class='bold'>wall A</span> on plan), wooden seats,
with canopy, holding good Gothic wood-carvings. Notice <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> of
door, a Deposition in the Tomb; (801) Madonna and Child;
then, Birth of the Virgin, with St. Anne in a bed; and below,
head of a Saint, hollow, intended to contain her skull or relics.
Near it (762), decapitation of St. John Baptist, German, 16th
century; and (789) Death of the Virgin. R of doorway, three
reliquary heads, and (783 and 784) two groups of the Education
of the Virgin. Above, several representations of the Circumcision.
<span class='bold'>Wall B</span>, between the windows, (745) quaint reliquary
head of St. Mabile, one of St. Ursula’s 11,000 virgins, the hair
gilt, Italian, 15th century; near it, Angel of the Annunciation;
Madonna and Child; and Flight into Egypt. Fine wooden
chests. In the <span class='bold'>cases</span>, collections of <span class='bold'>shoes</span>, uninteresting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Room III.—Wood-carvings, more or less Gothic. <span class='bold'>Wall A</span>,
(788) Madonna supporting the dead Christ, under a canopy,
16th century; (816) Holy Women, with small figure of the donor,
kneeling. (709) large carved altar-piece, end of 15th century;
in the centre, Crucifixion, with quaintly brutal Roman soldiers,
fainting Madonna, and Holy Women in fantastic head-dresses
of the period; below, Nativity, and Adoration of the Magi; <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>
side, above, Flagellation, with grotesquely cruel soldiers;
beneath it, angels displaying the napkin of St. Veronica; <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>
side, above, Deposition in the Tomb; beneath it, angels supporting
the instruments of the Passion—a splendid piece of
Flemish carving. Above, two statues of St. George. Further
on (712), votive triptych against the plague, Flemish, carved,
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>
with painted flaps on the doors; <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, St. Sebastian, with arrows of
the pestilence; <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, St. Roch exhibiting his plague-spot, with
angel who consoled him and dog who fed him (see the legend
in Mrs. Jameson); centre, Adoration of the Magi; the Three
Kings represent (as usual) the three ages of man, and also the
three old continents, Europe, Asia, Africa; hence the youngest
king is represented as a Moor. Other episodes (Flight into
Egypt, Return of Magi, etc.), in the background—late 15th
century. <span class='bold'>Wall B</span>, first window, stained glass, German panes,
15th century, Annunciation, in two panels (1960 and 1957).
Beyond it (830), in woodwork, 16th century, Coronation of the
Virgin by Christ and God the Father—a somewhat unusual
treatment. Above (758), Stem of Jesse, representing the descent
of Christ; notice David with his harp and other kings of Israel;
late 15th century. Second window (1958 and 1959), St. Hubert
and St. Lambert, companions to the Annunciation; (721)
dainty little Crucifixion (16th century), in coloured German
wood-carving; (1686) Flemish painting, school of Van Eyck,
Crucifixion. <span class='bold'>Wall D</span>, windows (1961 and 1962), St. Peter and
St. George; (1963 and 1964) St. Hubert, and St. Antony Abbot
(with his pig, staff, and bell). <span class='bold'>Wall C</span>, altar-piece, unnumbered;
subjects much as opposite; centre, Crucifixion; beneath it,
Nativity, Adoration of Magi. L, Way to Calvary (with grotesquely
brutal soldiers); beneath it, Annunciation (notice the
<span class='it'>prie-dieu</span>, book, and bed in the background), and Visitation; <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>,
Descent from the Cross, with St. John and the Marys; beneath
it, Circumcision, and Presentation in the Temple. (710)
Deposition from the Cross, very good, with painted wings
from the Passion. All the wood-carvings in this room deserve
careful attention. Inspect them all, and, as far as possible,
discover their subjects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Room IV.—Fine Renaissance chimney-piece, by Hugues
Lallement, 16th century, representing Actæon transformed into
a stag by Diana, whom he has surprised in the act of bathing.
(Subjects from the myth of Diana are favourites with the
French Renaissance artists, owing to the influence of Diane
de Poitiers.) From Châlons-sur-Marne, same house as that in
Room II. <span class='bold'>Wall A</span> (1779 and 1778), Renaissance classical paintings,
part of a large series continued elsewhere; (1428) fine
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>
Renaissance carved cabinet (Diana and Chimæras); contrast
this and neighbouring Renaissance work with the mediæval
carvings in adjacent rooms. <span class='bold'>Wall B</span> (6329), quaint old Flemish
tapestry, representing the Angels appearing to the Shepherds;
the Nativity; the Adoration of the Magi; and the Agony in the
Garden. Study the arrangement of all these figures, which are
conventional, and will reappear in many other examples of
various arts. <span class='bold'>Wall C</span>, <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> and <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> of fireplace, good Renaissance
wood-carving. <span class='bold'>Wall D</span>, fine cabinets. In the cases, medals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Room V, to the side. <span class='bold'>Debased Italian and Spanish work</span>
of the 17th and 18th centuries. <span class='bold'>Centre</span>, Adoration of the Magi,
a meretricious Neapolitan group of the 17th century, intended
to place in a church as a Christmas <span class='it'>berceau</span>. The costumes of
the Three Kings, representing the three continents, the ruined
temple in which the action takes place, and the antique statue
in the background of the Madonna and St. Joseph, should all
be noticed. Contemptible as a work of art, this florid composition
of dolls is interesting and valuable for its spirited arrangement,
and for the light it casts on the conception of the subject.
The room also contains other similar church furniture of the
17th and 18th centuries. Observe their theatrical tinsel style
and their affected pietism, as contrasted with the simplicity,
naïveté, and truth of earlier periods. Take, as an extreme
example of this tendency, the relief of the Annunciation on
<span class='bold'>Wall D</span>, to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> of the entrance door, and compare it with
examples of the same subject in other rooms of the collection.
<span class='bold'>Wall B</span>, facing the entrance, good case of miscellaneous woodwork
containing excellent Spanish art of this bad period—a
Last Supper, a St. Francis receiving the Stigmata, a Massacre
of the Innocents, the Faint of St. Catherine, St. Antony the
Abbot, St. Antony of Padua carrying the infant Christ, and
other figures. A large gilt tabernacle, on <span class='bold'>Wall C</span>, also contains
a debased figure of St. Anthony of Padua, from an altar dedicated
to the Saint. Identify as many of these saints as possible,
and remember their symbols.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We now quit the older suite of apartments, and enter a large
central glass-covered court—<span class='sc'>Room VI</span>, entirely modern. The
<span class='bold'>Corridor</span> is occupied by early altar paintings, for the most
part of little value. Notice on the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, by the staircase (1701),
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>
a Giottesque Madonna and Child—Florentine, 15th century.
Near it (1666), two oval panels, representing the Annunciation,
divided (as frequently happens with this subject) into two distinct
portions, and probably flanking a doorway in their original
position—Italian, 14th century. All the paintings on this wall,
mostly unsatisfactory as works of art, are valuable for their
symbolism and the light they throw on the evolution of their
subjects. For example: (1676), between the Annunciation
pictures, represents the distribution of holy wine which has
touched the relics (I think) of St. Hubert. Further on, we have
a group of six Apostles; beginning from the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, St. Peter with
the keys, St. John Evangelist with the cup and serpent, St.
Andrew with his cross, St. Bartholomew with his knife, St.
James the Greater with the pilgrim’s staff and scallop, and St.
James the Less with a crosier and book. R of the staircase is
a stone figure of St. Denis bearing his head, French, 15th century;
also, a good statue of the Madonna, a little later. Above
the doorway, <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, are portions of a large Spanish altar-piece;
in the centre, the Crucifixion; extreme <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, Assumption of the
Virgin, etc. Beyond it comes the continuation of the tabernacle
already noticed, containing the six remaining Apostles, with the
symbols of their martyrdom. Next, a fine Spanish altar-piece
of the 15th century, from a church of St. Martin; in the centre,
St. Martin dividing his cloak with the beggar; round it various
other subjects, among them St. Antony with his pig, St.
Stephen, in deacon’s robes, with the stones of his martyrdom,
St. Jerome in the desert beating his bosom with a flint before
the crucifix, St. Francis displaying the stigmata or five wounds
of Christ, St. Paul the hermit with his lion, etc. <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, towards
the courtyard, a fine figure of Adam from St. Denis, a splendid
example of the best French nude sculpture of the 14th century.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We now enter the <span class='bold'>covered courtyard</span> or <span class='sc'>Room VI</span> proper,
filled with fine examples of French mediæval sculpture. Several
of the objects bear labels sufficiently descriptive. I will therefore
only call attention to a few among them. <span class='bold'>Wall D</span>, two
wooden Flemish statues (Our Lady and St. John at Calvary),
<span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> and <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> of the doorway; (417) carved marble monument of the
10th or 11th century; very fine workmanship, with distinct
reminiscences of the antique. <span class='bold'>Wall A</span>, <span class='bold'>*</span>Magnificent stone
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>
frieze or reredos, originally gilt and coloured, representing the
History of St. Benedict, from St. Denis; in the centre, Baptism
in Jordan (compare the relief of the same subject in Notre-Dame);
<span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> and <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, preaching and miracles of St. Benedict (overthrow
of idols, cure of a dying woman). Middle of wall (6328),
fine Italian tapestry, 16th century, representing the Adoration
of the Magi; observe the attitude of the kings, together with
the ox and ass in the background, invariable concomitants of
the Nativity in art. Beneath (728), early wooden Madonna
(13th century, Auvergne), with Byzantine aspect. Beautiful
Romanesque capitals—Creation of Eve, etc. <span class='bold'>Wall B*</span>(237),
exquisite stone frieze or reredos from the church of St. Germer,
about 1259, much-mutilated, but originally one of the most
perfect specimens of French 13th century carving; it still betrays
traces of colour. In the centre, Crucifixion, with Virgin
and St. John: on either side (as at Notre-Dame), the Church,
with cross and chalice, and the Synagogue, with eyes blinded:
then, <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> and <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> of cross, St. Peter and St. Paul: beyond them,
Annunciation and Visitation: finally, <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, St. Ouen, uncle of St.
Germer, cures a wounded warrior; <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, St. Germer asks leave of
King Dagobert to found the Abbey from which this came.
Above it (509), exquisitely grotesque relief of the Resurrection
with sleeping Roman soldiers, one of a set in alabaster, French
14th century (500 to 512), all of which deserve to be inspected;
meanings of all are obvious except (501) St. Ursula. Still
higher, fragment of the original Last Judgment on the central
west door of Notre-Dame, Paris, before the restoration—interesting
as showing the grounds on which Viollet-le-Duc proceeded;
(6322), tapestry, Arras, 15th century, various scriptural
subjects, confused, but decipherable. Beneath it, <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, <span class='bold'>*</span>beautiful
stone relief (reredos) of the legend of St. Eustace, from the
church of St. Denis—a fine French work of the 14th century.
In the centre, Crucifixion; extreme <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, St. Eustace, hunting, is
converted by the apparition of the Christ between the horns of
the stag he is pursuing; further <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, his baptism, nude, in a font, as
in all early representations; still further <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, his trials and history;
while he crosses a river with one of his children, a wolf seizes one,
while a lion devours the other; last of all, reunited miraculously
with his family, he and they are burned alive as martyrs by the
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>
Emperor Trajan, in a brazen bull. Observe naïf boy with bellows.
The whole most delicately and gracefully sculptured.
Next, coloured stone relief of the Passion—French 14th century;
subjects, from <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> to <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>: the kiss of Judas (observe Peter drawing
the sword); Flagellation; Bearing of the Cross, with Simon of
Cyrene; Deposition in the Tomb; Resurrection; and Christ
in Hades, delivering Adam and Eve from the jaws of death,
realistically represented here and elsewhere as the mouth of a
monster; notice in this work the colour and the Gothic architecture
and decoration of the background, which help one to
understand features that are missing in many other of these
reredoses. Then, stone relief of the Annunciation, Visitation,
and Nativity, very simply treated: notice the usual ox and ass
in the manger. Above it, <span class='bold'>*</span>(4763), good mosaic of the Madonna
and Child with adoring angels, by Davide Ghirlandajo, of
Florence, placed by the President Jean de Ganay (as the inscription
attests) in the church of St. Merri at Paris. <span class='bold'>Wall C</span>
(513–518), interesting alabaster reliefs of the Passion, French,
14th century. Between them, Coronation of the Virgin, French,
15th century. (725) Good wooden figure of St. Louis, covered
with fleur-de-lis in gold, from the Sainte Chapelle. [Here is
the door which leads to the Musée des Thermes. Pass it by
for the present.] Beyond it, continuation of the alabaster
reliefs (514 and 517), etc.: examine them closely. Between
them (435), Circumcision, in marble, early 15th century, French,
full of character. Beneath it (429, etc.), admirable figures of
mourners, from the tomb of Philippe le Hardi, at Dijon, 14th
century. <span class='bold'>Wall D</span>, again (1291), terra-cotta, coloured: Madonna
and St. Joseph, with angels, adoring the Child (child missing),
ox and ass in background; <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, Adoration of Magi; notice once
more the conventional arrangement: <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, Marriage of the Virgin,
a high priest joining her hand to Joseph’s, all under Gothic
canopies, 15th century, from the chapel of St. Éloy, near
Bernay, Eure. I omit many works of high merit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>centre</span> of this room is occupied by several good statues.
Examine each; the descriptive labels are usually sufficient.
(A noble <span class='bold'>*</span>St. Catherine; St. Barbara with her tower; St.
Sebastian, pierced with the holes where the arrows have been;
a beautiful long-haired wooden Madonna; a fine [Pisan] Angel
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>
of the Annunciation, in wood, etc.) Also, several excellent
figures of Our Lady. The large part played by the Madonna
in this Room, indeed, is typical of her importance in France,
and especially in Paris, from the 13th century onward. The
church of Notre-Dame is partly a result, partly a cause, of this
special cult of the Blessed Virgin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Room VII (beyond the corridor, a modern covered courtyard).—<span class='bold'>Tapestries
and textile fabrics</span>, interesting chiefly to
ladies. On <span class='bold'>Wall A</span>, and others, Flemish tapestry, representing
the History of Bathsheba, much admired and very ugly; compare
it with the tapestry of the Lady and the Unicorn, to be
visited later in <span class='sc'>Room III</span>, upstairs, contrasting them as models
of what such work should and should not be. <span class='bold'>Wall B</span>, admirable
Renaissance relief of the Cardinal Virtues. Above it, a
good Madonna, and figures of Grammar and Astronomy.
<span class='bold'>Wall C</span>, Caryatid of inferior art, French, 16th century. <span class='bold'>**</span>(448),
Admirable group of the Three Fates, attributed to Germain
Pilon, the great French sculptor of the 16th century, whom we
shall meet again at the Louvre—a fine specimen of the plastic
art of the Renaissance, said to represent Diane de Poitiers and
her daughters. Below <span class='bold'>**</span>(447), exquisite Renaissance bas-relief
of the huntress Diana, of the School of Jean Goujon, again in
allusion to Diane de Poitiers. (478) Good mask of the same
epoch. (251) Virgin and Child, meretricious; in the decadent
style of the 16th century; very French in type, foreshadowing
the Louis XV spirit—the Madonna resembles a little-reputable
court lady. <span class='bold'>Wall D</span> (463, etc.), Judgment of Solomon, Solomon
and the Queen of Sheba, Annunciation, and other reliefs
in the florid and least pleasing French style of the 16th and
17th centuries. Table by the doorway <span class='bold'>**</span>(449), exquisite small
marble statue of the Deserted Ariadne (perhaps Diane de
Poitiers), in the best Renaissance manner, probably by
Germain Pilon: found in the Loire, near Diane’s <span class='it'>château</span>
of Chaumont. Beside it, three sleeping Venuses, one of which
is also said to be Diane de Poitiers, the goddess of the Renaissance
in Paris. L of doorway (457), singular marble relief of
Christ and the Magdalen after the Resurrection (Noli me
tangere); the Saviour strangely represented (as often) in a
gardener’s hat and with a spade; in the background, angels
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>
by the empty sepulchre; Flemish, florid style of the 16th
century. Beside it (467 and 468), two exquisite Renaissance
reliefs of Venus. In front of it, on the table <span class='bold'>*</span>(479), Entombment,
with the body of Christ placed in the sarcophagus by
Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus—portraits, I think, of the
donors.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Room VIII</span>—Textile fabrics and ecclesiastical robes. <span class='bold'>Wall B</span>,
<span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> of door (487), pretty but meretricious little group of Venus and
Cupids, with grapes, French style of the 17th century; the
national taste still more distinctly showing itself. R of door
(459), in two separate figures, a quaint Annunciation—French,
16th century, frankly anachronistic. Close by (464), the Judgment
of Solomon, same school and period. Above (563), clever
small alabaster group of the Rape of the Sabines, after Giovanni
da Bologna. These all stand on a handsome French carved chest
of the 16th century. <span class='bold'>Wall C</span>, greatly worn altar-relief of the
Adoration of the Magi, from the chapel of the Château d’Anet,
French Renaissance, 16th century. Above it (446), Mary Magdalen,
kneeling, with long hair and the alabaster box of ointment—her
symbol in art—15th century, curious. At the back, gilt
and painted figures of the Holy Trinity, from the demolished
church of St. Marcel at Paris, 17th century. Similar representations
of the Trinity, showing the three Persons thus, are
common in Italian art. Further on (493), good figure of a
shepherd, French, 16th century. <span class='bold'>Wall A</span> (266), curious altar
back, Herod ordering the Massacre of the Innocents. (267)
St. Eustace crossing the river (see Room VI) with the lion and
the wolf seizing his children. A very different treatment from
the previous one. (291) A lintel of a chimney, Flemish, dated
1555; centre, a river-god; <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> and <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, pelican and eagle; between
the figures, Faith, Hope, Charity and Prudence. (273) Madonna
and Child (Notre-Dame de l’Espérance, throned on an anchor).
On the wall, far <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, interesting piece of French 14th century
tapestry, with a legend of St. Marcel and St. John Evangelist,
most naïvely represented.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Room IX.</span>—State coaches and Sedan chairs of the 17th century,
as ugly as can be imagined. They need not detain you.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>staircase</span> to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>FIRST FLOOR</span> is in the Corridor to Room
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>
VI. Observe the staircase itself, in carved wood, bearing the
arms of France and Navarre, and also the crowned initials of
Henri IV and Marie de Médicis. It was formerly in the old
Chambre des Comptes of Paris, and was re-erected here at the
installation of the Museum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>corridor</span> above contains arms and armour. At the head
of the staircase (742), very quaint Magdalen in wood with the
box of ointment; German in style, 15th century; observe her
long hair, here twisted and plaited with German neatness.
(1466 and 1468) Renaissance cabinets in ebony.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Room I.</span>—Gallery, looking down on the courtyard of Room
VI, below. <span class='bold'>Wall D</span>, by which you enter; tiles, French Renaissance.
<span class='bold'>Wall C</span>: first case, blue Flemish stoneware. Fine
wrought-iron gates, gilt. In front of them, female Satyr, French,
18th century, very characteristic of the national taste; opposite
it, male Satyr, the same. Second case: Palissy ware, French
16th and 17th centuries. This fine ware is full of Renaissance
feeling. Notice particularly (3140), a Sacrifice of Abraham;
(3145) the Baptism in Jordan, conventional treatment; (3139)
Judith and Holofernes, with several other scriptural scenes in
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>
the older spirit; intermingled with these are classical and mythological
scenes, displaying the growing love for the nude;
observe particularly (3119), a Venus with Cupids; and another
dish below it, unnumbered, same subject; also, a Creation of
Eve; (3131) Susanna and the Elders, and other scenes of
similar character. Observe that while the early work is purely
scriptural or sacred, the Renaissance introduces classical subjects.
Note too the frequent scenes of the Baptism in the same connection.
Centre (3102), beautiful vase with lid, of the period of
Henri II. Study all the Palissy ware. <span class='bold'>Wall B</span>, French pottery
of the 18th century, exhibiting the rapid decline in taste under
Louis XIV and XV, especially as regards colour. The most
satisfactory pieces are the blue and white dishes with royal monograms,
arms, etc. Second case: Rouen ware of the 18th century,
far superior in style and tone to the preceding. Good nude
figure of Venus. <span class='bold'>Wall A</span>, Nevers pottery, delicate blue and
white; (3338) figure of a page, to support a lamp. Last case:
Dutch pottery, Delft, 18th century, exhibiting the strong domestic
Dutch tendency.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Room II.</span>—Also galleries, surrounding a courtyard. Exquisite
Italian Renaissance pottery. <span class='bold'>Wall B</span>, <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> of entrance,
beautiful Italian specimens of Faenza ware, 15th and 16th centuries
(whence the word <span class='it'>faïence</span>); these should be closely studied
in detail. (2811) Quaint dish with Diana as archer; beside it,
portraits. (2824 and 2825) Decorative plaques with heads of
women. (3949) St. George and the Dragon in green pottery.
Behind it, plate with admirable portrait. In the same case,
Judith receiving the head of Holofernes; (3024) Hercules
playing the lyre to entice Auge. <span class='bold'>Wall C</span>, first case, Deruta
and Chaffagiolo ware of the 16th century. Exquisite decorative
dishes and plaques; (2814) Actæon changed to a stag by
Diana. (2849) Susanna and the Elders. (2887) St. Jerome
in the desert, with his lion. (2895) The doubting Thomas.
(2823) Another Actæon. Observe frequent repetition of certain
scenes. Fine plates with arms of Medici Popes, etc.
Second case: Deruta ware, still more splendid specimens,
many of them with remarkable lustre. (2894) Madonna and
Child, with infant St. John of Florence. Other plates with
Mercury, a sphinx, a lion, the huntress Diana, a Moor’s head,
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>
portraits and decorative designs. Examine in detail. <span class='bold'>Wall
D</span>, first case, Casteldurante and Gubbio ware, 16th century
(3007) Manius Curtius leaping into the Forum. (3015) Crucifixion,
with the sun and the moon darkened. (3004) Dædalus
and the Minotaur. (3008) Fine conventional design. Other
plates have heads of St. Paul and mythological persons. (2802)
a quaint Temptation of St. Antony. (2818) Leda and the
Swan, etc. Second case: Urbino ware, 17th century. Head
of Raphael, and delicate Raphaelesque scenes, instinct with
the later Renaissance feeling. (2961) Perseus and Andromeda.
(3064) Expulsion from Paradise; on either side, Temptation,
and Adam eating the fruit. (2872) a Baptism in Jordan.
Notice again the mixture of religious and mythological scenes,
with a preference for those where the nude is permissible—Judith
and Holofernes, Orpheus, etc. <span class='bold'>Wall A</span>, fine Florentine
terra-cotta bust of the young St. John, patron saint of the
city. More Urbino ware, to be carefully examined. The
greater part of this wall, however, is occupied by <span class='bold'>**Della
Robbia</span> ware, glazed Florentine majolica of the 15th and 16th
centuries. (2794) Fine figure of St. Michael. (2799) Martyrdom
of St. Catherine, the wheels of her torture broken by
angels. Above it, Madonna adoring the Child; observe in
this and many other cases the beautiful setting of fruit and
flowers, characteristic of the Delia Robbias. Beneath, no
number, the Beheading of St. Catherine; in the background,
angels conveying her soul to Heaven. (2795) The Infant St.
John, patron Saint of Florence. (2793) Temperance, with
flagon and patera. Then, more Urbino ware, very fine examples
of the end of the 16th century; above them, touching Madonna
and Child, Della Robbia. <span class='bold'>Wall B</span>, again, Castello ware,
and Venetian pottery, 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. Apothecary’s
jars, plaques, etc., extremely beautiful.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Room III.</span>—A long corridor. <span class='bold'>Wall A</span>, is entirely occupied
by the <span class='bold'>**</span>magnificent suite of six early French tapestries,
known as “The Lady and the Unicorn” (symbol of chastity),
the finest work of its sort ever executed. They come from the
Château de Boussac, and belong to the second half of the 15th
century. The Lady is represented engaged in various domestic
pursuits of a woman of rank of her time, always accompanied
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>
by the beast of chastity. The colour is inexpressibly
lovely. Above it, similar tapestry representing the History of
St. Stephen, and the Discovery of his Relics. Along <span class='bold'>Wall A</span>,
<span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> of entrance door (774), crowned wooden figure of St.
Catherine, holding the sword of her martyrdom, her broken
wheel at her feet, and trampling upon the tyrant, Maximian.
<span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> of door, good early Madonna and Child; another St.
Catherine; and (760) Magdalen, described (erroneously, I
think) as Pandora. <span class='bold'>Wall B</span> is mostly occupied by a handsome
French Renaissance chimney-piece (16th century), brought
here from a house at Rouen, and representing the history of
the Casa Santa at Loreto,—its transport over the sea by angels,
its reception by the Faithful, and worship in front of it. The
ceiling above also comes from the same room. <span class='bold'>Wall C</span>, small
stained-glass windows of various ages. Examine them separately.
<span class='bold'>Wall D</span>, large enamelled plaques brought from François
Premier’s Château of Madrid, in the Bois de Boulogne, stated
to be the largest enamels in existence. Beneath them, fine
wooden statue of the Virgin and infant Christ, German 15th
century, very characteristic in its flat features, as well as in the
dress, and treatment of the hair, of the German style of the
period. Compare it with French Madonnas below. The
<span class='bold'>screens</span> towards <span class='bold'>Wall A</span> contain specimens of fine Renaissance
wood-carving. Contrast the finish and style of these with
their Gothic predecessors. Notice, near the chimney-piece
(828), an Annunciation, with God the Father, wearing a triple
crown (like the Pope), and the Holy Spirit descending upon
the Madonna. Next screen, various classical scenes in the
taste of the Renaissance—Judgment of Paris, Venuses and
Cupids, etc. Much fine nude Renaissance detail. <span class='bold'>Centre
case</span>, old glass; notice, in particular (4763), fine 13th century
Arab mosque-lamp. Further on, more Renaissance wood-carving—Leda
and the Swan in very high relief: low reliefs
of classical subjects and decorative panels. All these
works should be closely studied as typically illustrative of
Renaissance feeling. <span class='bold'>Cases by the window (wall C)</span>,
Limoges and other enamels, too numerous to treat in full detail,
but many of them, at least, should be closely inspected and
comprehended by the visitor. Case <span class='bold'>next</span> the chimney-piece,
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>
old raised enamels (12th and 13th centuries), enamelled gold
reliquaries for containing bones of Saints; fine crucifix, etc.
Notice on 4497, the Flight into Egypt, Peter walking on the
Sea, the Adoration of the Magi, and the Presentation in the
Temple; on 4498, the Crucifixion, and the Twelve Apostles;
beneath, 4514, enamelled book-cover; near it, Crucifixion,
Adoration of the Magi, and other figures. Identify as many of
these as possible, and observe their archaic striving after effects
too high for the artist. Second case: Limoges enamels, more
modern in type (15th century): Madonna holding the dead
Christ, Crucifixion, Bearing of the Cross, and other scenes.
Notice particularly (4575), little triptych with a Nativity, Adoration
of the Magi, and Circumcision, in all of which observe
the conventional treatment. Third case: Limoges enamels of
the High Renaissance (16th and 17th centuries), Raphaelesque
in spirit, better in execution, but far less interesting; good portraits
in frames; a fine Flagellation, and other scenes from the
Passion; above, delicate Tazzas. Observe in particular (4628),
the Descent into Hell, Christ rescuing Adam and Eve and the
other dead from Hades, typically Renaissance. On the far
side of the case, remote from window, a good series of the
Gospel history,—Marriage of the Virgin, Annunciation, Birth
of the Virgin (incorrectly labelled Nativity), etc. Last cases:
more recent enamels. Among the best are, in the last case of
all, the Expulsion from Paradise, and a series of the Gospel
History; observe particularly (4650), Christ and the Magdalen,
with the usual curious disguise as a gardener. I recommend
to those who can spare the time, most attentive detailed study
of the subjects and treatment in all these enamels, many of
which throw much light on similar themes treated by other arts
in the same collection. Several hours should, if possible, be
devoted to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Room IV</span> contains various <span class='bold'>**Mohammedan potteries</span>, exquisitely
decorative, but (owing to the general absence of figure
subjects, prohibited by Islam) requiring comparatively little
explanation. Occasional animal forms, however, occur in the
midst of the usually decorative arabesque patterns. <span class='bold'>Wall C</span>,
<span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> of entrance, charming Rhodian pottery (made by Persian
workmen), in prevailing tones of blue and green, with the
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>
wonderful Persian feeling for colour. <span class='bold'>Wall B</span>, Hispano-Moorish
lustre ware, the most exquisitely beautiful ever manufactured.
The second case contains several lovely specimens.
<span class='bold'>Wall A</span>, Rhodian ware again. <span class='bold'>Wall D</span>, Persian. The
reader must examine these minutely for himself. It is impossible
to do more than point out their beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Room V.</span>—<span class='bold'>Jewish</span> works of art of the Middle Ages, interesting
as showing the wealth and artistic taste of the mediæeval
Hebrews—phylacteries, seven-branched candlesticks, goldsmiths’
work, etc. (188) Chimney-piece (Christian) from an
old house at Le Mans. The groups represent the three ages
of life: right and left, the two sexes—man, armed; woman,
with a ball of wool.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Room VI.</span>—<span class='bold'>Wall C</span>, opposite windows, carved chest (1360),
French, 17th century, with figures in high relief of the Twelve
Apostles. The paintings above it (1704, 1707, 1714), etc., are
the fronts of similar chests, Florentine, 15th century. Such
boxes were commonly given to a bride to contain her trousseau
and household linen. For instance, one (1710) contains the
mythical history of a betrothal and wedding (Æneas and
Lavinia). The others have in many cases similar appropriate
subjects from classical story. (1455) Florentine mosaic cabinet,
in the worst taste. Beyond it, other cabinets and fronts of
wedding chests. This room also contains musical instruments,
interesting as illustrating the evolution of modern forms. Also,
florid Italian inlaid tables, in the bad expensive taste of the
17th century. In the windows, stained glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Room VII.</span>—Carved oak cabinets. (1435) Good Flemish
work of the 17th century.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Room VIII.</span>—(189) Carved chimney-piece, similar to that in
the Jewish room, and from the same house; marriage scene,
allegorical. Carved wooden cabinets and portals, all interesting,
but requiring little description. (1431) Again the favourite
Renaissance device of Actæon and Diana. Carved oak bed, of
age of François I<sup>er</sup>, with hangings of the same period. (1509)
Good panel of a chair, with the Presentation of the Virgin in
the Temple by Saints Joachim and Anna; above, Nativity;
then Adoration of the Magi, and Flight into Egypt; on the
front, patron saints of the owners.
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Room IX.</span>—<span class='bold'>**</span>Magnificent collection of ivories and ebonies,
all of which the spectator should examine in detail. Nothing
in this museum is more interesting. Notice, for example, the
beautiful triptych<span class='bold'>**</span>(1081) in the centre of the <span class='bold'>first case</span> by
the window of <span class='bold'>Wall D</span>; lower tier, Annunciation; Shepherds;
Joseph and the Madonna, with the babe in the manger; and
Adoration of the Magi; upper tier, Kiss of Judas, Crucifixion,
and Christ and the Magdalen in the Garden; beautiful Italian
work of the 14th century. L of it <span class='bold'>**</span>(1088), exquisite coloured
triptych with Madonna and Child; <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, St. Paul (with his sword)
and St. Catherine; <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, St. Peter and the Magdalen; notice
their symbols. Several small ivories in the same case should
be observed carefully. Below the large triptych, for example,
are scenes from the Passion (<span class='it'>not</span> chronologically arranged in
their existing order), namely, from <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> to <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, Crown of Thorns,
Scourging, Resurrection, Ascension, Disciples at Emmaus,
Apparition to the three Marys, Peter on the Sea, and Christ
with the Magdalen; very naïve French work of the 15th century.
(718) Exquisite little wood-carving of the Crucifixion, with scenes
from the Passion; Spanish, 16th century. Above it (7227),
comb, with Adoration of the Magi; 14th century, very curious.
The <span class='bold'>next case</span> contains still earlier and more interesting work.
In the centre, a triptych; lower tier, Adoration of the Magi,
Madonna with angels, Presentation in the Temple; upper tier,
Bearing the Cross, Crucifixion, and Descent from the Cross;
exquisite French work, in high relief, of the 14th century. L of
it (1082), Scenes from the Passion, Last Supper, Agony in the
Garden, Kiss of Judas (with Peter cutting off Malchus’s ear),
Flagellation, etc. Each compartment here consists of two
subjects, which identify; charming French work of the 14th
century. Above it (1085 and 1086), secular scenes, life in a
garden—14th century. R of the triptych (1065, 1063, 1066,
1064), legends of saints; St. Denis beheaded and bearing his
head; Flagellation of an unknown Martyr, who takes it most
comfortably; St. Peter, crucified, head downward; and other
episodes—charming French 14th century work. Examine all
the pieces in this case carefully. In the first case, towards the
<span class='bold'>centre of the room</span>, early ivory-carvings, a <span class='bold'>*</span>consular diptych
of the 5th or 6th century, very interesting; and other works
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>
still displaying classical influence. (1035) Byzantine, Christ
and Saints. (1049) Death of the Virgin; fine work showing
Byzantine influence; 12th century. (1054) Extremely rude
Northern 11th century ivory, representing scriptural scenes,
mingled with decorative animals treated in withy-band fashion.
(1038) Fine Italo-Byzantine plaque with Crucifixion and Saints,
the name of each inscribed beside him. <span class='bold'>Central case:</span> Ivory
statuettes, all deserving close attention. (1032) Antique Roman
goddess. (1037) Fine early French Madonna; 10th century.
Behind her (1052), beautiful ivory reliquary, French, 12th
century, with figures of Saints; <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, the personages of the Adoration
(<span class='it'>i.e.</span>, the Three Kings) bearing their gifts, and with their
names inscribed above them; <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, the personages of the Presentation—Madonna,
Joseph, Simeon. Further side (1060),
beautiful coloured ivory coffer, 14th century, with numerous
scriptural scenes, easily recognisable; identify them. Inspect
also the <span class='bold'>ebony cabinets</span>, of which 1458, time of Henri IV.
with classical scenes, is a magnificent Renaissance example.
By <span class='bold'>Wall A</span>, more <span class='bold'>ebony cabinets</span> and carvings, and exquisite
ivory statuettes, of later date, among which notice particularly
(1141) a Portuguese Madonna; (1163) a Spanish St. Peter;
(1164) Spanish St. Antony of Padua; and (1167) a very curious
Peruvian Good Shepherd, showing distinct traces of native art,
influenced by introduced Spanish feeling. Further to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>,
good classical figures of the later Renaissance. I have only
indicated a few of the most interesting among these exquisite
carvings; but many hours may be devoted to this room, by
those who can afford the time, with great advantage.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Room X.</span>—Bronzes and Renaissance metal work, mostly
self-explanatory. (193) Chimney-piece from a house in Troyes—French,
16th century; Plenty, surrounded by Fauns and
trophies. Good collection of keys, knives, etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Room XI.</span>—<span class='bold'>Goldsmith’s work</span> and objects in the precious
metals. <span class='bold'>Wall A</span> (4988), gold altar-piece of the Emperor Henry
II, of Germany, with Christ, and figures of Saints, bearing their
names above them, given by the Emperor to Bâle Cathedral in
the beginning of the 11th century. Central case, <span class='bold'>the Guerrazar
find</span>: votive offerings of crowns of the early Gothic kings of
Spain, the largest one being that of Reccesvinthus (died 672),
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>
discovered near Toledo. The crowns are rude Byzantine
work of the 7th century, inlaid with precious stones. The
names inscribed below them were probably added when they
were made into votive offerings. Uninteresting as works of art,
these curious relics possess great value as specimens of the
decadent workmanship of their period. Most of the other objects
in this room derive their importance more from the material
of which they are composed than from artistic beauty, or even
relative antiquarian importance. Of these (4994), in the case
near <span class='bold'>Wall D</span>, represents the Last Supper, with the fish which
in very early Christian work is a symbol of Christ. Near it,
quaint figures of the four Evangelists, writing, with their symbols.
Other symbols of the Evangelists in the same case. Quaint
Nuremberg figure of St. Anne, holding on her knee the crowned
Madonna, and a little box to contain a relic. (5008) Reliquary
foot of a Saint, to enclose his bones; it bears his name—Alard.
(4995) Curious figure of the Madonna, Limoges work,
very Byzantine in aspect. Other cases contain crucifixes,
monstrances, and similar articles of church furniture in the
precious metals, mostly of early date. The case by <span class='bold'>Wall B</span> has
Gallic torques and Merovingian jewellery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Return to Room VIII, and enter <span class='sc'>Room XII</span> to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>. It
contains bed furniture and book-bindings. (782) Fine Renaissance
Flagellation, after Sebastiano del Piombo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From this room we enter</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>The Chapel,</p>

<p class='noindent'>a small apartment, with roof sustained by a single pillar.
Good niches, now destitute of their saints; church furniture of
the Middle Ages, much of which deserves close attention. (708)
Fine wooden altar-piece, Flemish, 15th century: centre, the
Mass of St. Gregory, with Christ appearing bodily in the Holy
Sacrament; beneath it, adoring angels; <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> wing, Abraham and
Melchisedek, frankly mediæval; <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> wing, the Last Supper; an
excellent specimen. Other objects are: (726) Stiff early
wooden Madonna. (723) Crucifix, Auvergne, 12th century.
(727) St. John. End wall, Annunciation, with the Madonna
separated, as often, from the Angel Gabriel by a vase of lilies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The staircase in the corner leads out to the <span class='bold'>Garden</span>, where
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>
are several fragments of stone decoration. Pass through the
door, and traverse Room VI; the opposite door leads to</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>Les Thermes,</p>

<p class='noindent'>the remains of the old Roman palace. The scanty remnant, as
its name indicates, consists entirely of the baths attached to the
building. The masonry is massive. Fragments of Roman
altars and other remains found in Paris are arranged round the
room. The descriptive labels are sufficient for purposes of
identification.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='ch2b'>B. THE HILL OF STE. GENEVIÈVE<br/> (<span class='sc'>Panthéon, St. Étienne-du-Mont.</span>)</h2>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>[“High places” are always the first cemeteries and holy sites—as
at Montmartre and elsewhere. But the nearest rising
ground to Old Paris is the slight elevation just <span style='font-size:smaller'>S.</span> of Cluny,
now crowned by the colossal dome of the Panthéon. In
Frankish times, this hill lay quite outside the city; but on its
summit (just behind his Palace of Les Thermes), Clovis, after
his conversion by Ste. Geneviève, is said to have erected a
church to St. Peter and St. Paul. Here <span class='bold'>Ste. Geneviève</span> herself
was buried in 512; and the chapel raised over her tomb grew
into a church—the favourite place of pilgrimage for the inhabitants
of Paris. The actual body of the patron saint was enclosed,
in 550, in a magnificent shrine, executed by St. Éloy, the
holy blacksmith. Throughout the Middle Ages this church and
tomb of Ste. Geneviève, which occupied the site of the existing
Panthéon, nearby, were the objects of the greatest devotion.
St. Denis was the saint of the kings and nobles; but Ste.
Geneviève was, and still remains, the saint of the people, and
especially of the women. Miracles were constantly performed
at her shrine, and her aid was implored at all moments of
national danger or misfortune. A great (Augustin) abbey grew
up in time behind the church, and was dedicated in honour of
the holy shepherdess. The wall of Philippe Auguste bent
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>
abruptly southward in order to include her shrine and this
powerful abbey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the twelfth century, when the old church of St. Stephen
(in French, St. Étienne), on the site of Notre-Dame, was pulled
down in order to make room for the existing cathedral, the
relics of St. Stephen contained in it were transferred to a new
edifice—<span class='bold'>St. Étienne-du-Mont</span>—which was erected by the
monks, close to the Abbey of Ste. Geneviève, as a parish
church for their servants and dependents. In the sixteenth
century this second church of St. Stephen was pulled down,
with the exception of its tower, which is still standing. The
existing church of St. Étienne was then begun on the same site
in the Gothic style, and slowly completed with extensive Rennaissance
alterations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later still, the mediæval church of Ste. Geneviève, hard by,
having fallen into decay in the middle of the eighteenth century,
Louis XV determined to replace it by a sumptuous domed
edifice in the style of the period. This building, designed by
Soufflot, was not completed till the Revolution, when it was
immediately secularised as the <span class='bold'>Panthéon</span>, under circumstances
to be mentioned later. The remains of Ste. Geneviève, which
had lain temporarily meanwhile in a sumptuous chapel at St.
Étienne-du-Mont (the subsidiary church of the monastery)
were then taken out by the Revolutionists; the mediæval shrine,
or reliquary (which replaced St. Éloy’s), was ruthlessly broken
up; and the body of the patroness and preserver of Paris was
publicly burned in the Place de Grève. This, however, strange
to say, was not quite the end of Ste. Geneviève. A few of her
relics were said to have been preserved: some bones, together
with a lock of the holy shepherdess’s hair, were afterwards
recovered, and replaced in the sarcophagus they had once
occupied. Such at least is the official story; and these relics,
now once more enclosed in a costly shrine, still attract thousands
of votaries to the chapel of the saint in St. Étienne-du-Mont.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Panthéon, standing in front of the original church, is
now a secular burial-place for the great men of France. The
remains of Ste. Geneviève still repose at St. Étienne. Thus it
is impossible to dissociate the two buildings, which should be
visited together; and thus too it happens that the patroness
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>
of Paris has now no church in her own city. Local saints are
always the most important; this hill and Montmartre are still
the holiest places in Paris.]</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Proceed, as far as the garden of the Thermes, as on the
excursion to Cluny. Then continue straight up the Boulevard
St. Michel. The large edifice visible on the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> of the Rue
des Écoles to your <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, is the new building of the Sorbonne, or
University. Further up, at the Place du Sorbonne, the domed
church of the same name stands before you. It is the University
church, and is noticeable as the earliest true dome erected
in Paris. The next corner shows one, <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, the Luxembourg
garden, and <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, the Rue Soufflot, leading up to the <span class='bold'>Panthéon</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The colossal domed temple which replaces the ancient church
of Ste. Geneviève was begun by Soufflot, under Louis XV, in
imitation of St. Peter’s, at Rome. Like all architects of his
time, Soufflot sought merely to produce an effect of pagan or
“classical” grandeur, peculiarly out of place in the shrine of
the shepherdess of Nanterre. Secularised almost immediately
on its completion, during the Revolution, the building was
destined as the national monument to the great men of France,
and the inscription, “Aux Grands Hommes la Patrie Reconnaissante,”
which it still bears, was then first placed under the
sculptures of the pediment. Restored to worship by the Restoration,
it was again secularised under the Third Republic in
order to admit of the burial of Victor Hugo. The building
itself, a vast bare barn of the pseudo-classical type, very cold
and formal, is worthy of notice merely on account of its immense
size and its historic position; but it may be visited to
this day with pleasure, not only for some noble modern paintings,
but also for the sake of the reminiscences of Ste. Geneviève
which it still contains. Open daily, free, from 10 to 4,
Mondays excepted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>tympanum</span> has a group by David d’Angers, representing
France distributing wreaths to soldiers, politicians, men of
letters, men of science, and artists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>interior</span> is in the shape of a Greek cross (with equal arms).
Follow round the walls, beginning from the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>. In the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> Aisle
are paintings (modern) looking like frescoes, and representing
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>
the preaching of St. Denis, by Galand; and <span class='bold'>*</span>the history
of Ste. Geneviève—her childhood, recognition by St. Germain
l’Auxerrois, miracles, etc., delicate and elusive works, by Puvis
de Chavannes. The paintings of the South Transept represent
episodes in the early history of France. Chronologically
speaking, they begin from the <span style='font-size:smaller'>E.</span> central corner. Choir,
Death of Ste. Geneviève, by Laurens, and Miracles before her
Shrine. Apse of the tribune, fine modern (archaic) mosaic, by
Hébert, representing Christ with the Guardian Angel of France,
the Madonna, Jeanne d’Arc, and Ste. Geneviève. Stand under
the dome to observe the proportions of the huge, bare, unimpressive
building. L, or Northern Transept, <span style='font-size:smaller'>E</span> side, the history
of Jeanne d’Arc; she hears the voices; leads the assault at
Orleans; assists at the coronation of Charles VII at Rheims;
and is burnt at Rouen. W. side, St. Louis as a child instructed
by Blanche of Castille; administering justice in the Palace; and
a captive among the Saracens. N. aisle, history of Ste. Geneviève
and St. Denis (suite). The building is thus at once the apotheosis
of patriotism, and the lasting memorial of the part
borne by Christianity in French, and especially Parisian, history.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As you descend the steps of the Panthéon, the building that
faces you to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> is the Mairie of the 5th Arrondissement;
that to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, the École de Droit. Turn to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, along the <span style='font-size:smaller'>N</span>
side of the Panthéon. The long, low building which faces you
is the Bibliothèque Ste. Geneviève. Nothing now remains of
the Abbey of Ste. Geneviève except the tall early Gothic tower
seen to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, near the end of the Panthéon, and rising above
the modern buildings of the Lycée Henri IV. The singularly
picturesque and strangely-mingled church across the little
square is <span class='bold'>St. Étienne-du-Mont</span>, which we now proceed to
visit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stand in the left-hand corner of the Place to examine the
<span class='it'>façade</span>. The church was begun (1517) as late Gothic; but before
it was finished, the Renaissance style had come into fashion,
and the architects accordingly jumbled the two in the most
charming manner. The incongruity here only adds to the
beauty. The quaintly original Renaissance portal bears a
dedication to St. Stephen the Protomartyr, beneath which is
a relief of his martyrdom, with a Latin inscription, “Stone
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>
destroyed the temple of the Lord,” <span class='it'>i.e.</span>, Stephen, “Stone rebuilds
it.” R and <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> of the portal are statues of Sts. Stephen and
Geneviève, whose monograms also appear on the doors. In the
pediment is the usual representation of the Resurrection and
Last Judgment. Above it, the rose window, on either side of
which, in accordance with Italian rather than with French
custom (showing Italian Renaissance influence) are the Angel
of the Annunciation and the Madonna receiving his message.
In the third story, a gable-end. Singular tower to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, with an
additional round turret, a relic of the earlier Gothic building.
The whole <span class='it'>façade</span> (17th century), represents rather late Renaissance
than transitional architecture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>interior</span> is the most singular, and in some ways the most
picturesque, in Paris—a Gothic church, tricked out in Renaissance
finery. The nave is flanked by aisles, which are divided
from it by round pillars, capped by a singular balustrade
or gallery with low, flat arches, simulating a triforium. The
upper arches are round, and the decorations Renaissance; but
the vaulting, both of nave and aisles, with its pendant keystones,
recalls the Gothic style, as do also most of the windows.
Stand near the entrance, in the centre of the nave, and look up
the church. The most striking feature is the beautiful Renaissance
<span class='it'>jubé</span> or <span class='bold'>**rood-loft</span> (the only one now left in Paris) which
divides the Choir from the body of the building. This rood-loft
still bears a crucifix, for the reception of which it was originally
intended. On the arch below are two charmingly sculptured
Renaissance angels. The rood-loft is flanked by two spiral
staircases, which are wholly unique architectural features.
Notice also the exquisite pendentive of the roof at the point of
intersection of the nave and short false transepts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now walk up the Right Aisle. The first chapel is the Baptistery,
containing the font and a modern statue of the boy Baptist.
Third chapel, St. Antony of Padua. The fourth chapel contains
a curious Holy Sepulchre, with quaint life-size terra-cotta
figures of the 16th century. Fifth chapel, a gilt <span class='it'>châsse</span>. Notice
the transepts, reduced to short arms, scarcely, if at all, projecting
beyond the chapels. From this point examine the exquisite
Renaissance tracery of the rood-screen and staircases. Then
pass under the fine Renaissance door, with lovely decorative
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>
work, into the <span class='bold'>ambulatory</span>. The Choir is in large part Gothic,
with late flamboyant tracery. The apparent triforium is continued
round the ambulatory. The splendid gilded shrine in
the second choir-chapel contains the <span class='bold'>remains of Ste. Geneviève</span>,
or what is left of them. Candles burn perpetually around
it. Hundreds of votaries here pay their devotions daily to the
Patroness of Paris. The shrine, containing what is alleged to
be the original sarcophagus of the Saint (more probably of the
13th century) stands under a richly-gilt Gothic tabernacle,
adorned with figures legibly named on their pedestals. The
stained-glass window behind it has a representation of a processional
function with the body of the Saint, showing this
church, together with a view of the original church of Ste.
Geneviève, the remaining tower, and adjacent houses, historically
most interesting. The window beyond the shrine also
contains the history of Ste. Geneviève—her childhood, first
communion, miracles, distribution of bread during the siege of
Paris, conversion of Clovis, death, etc. Indeed the long sojourn
of the body of Ste. Geneviève in this church has almost overshadowed
its dedication to St. Stephen, several memorials of
whom may, however, be recognised by the attentive visitor—amongst
them, a picture of his martyrdom (by Abel de Pujol)
near the entrance to the choir. The Protomartyr also stands,
with his deacon’s robe and palm, in a niche near the door of the
sacristy, where <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> and <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> are frescoes of his Disputation with the
Doctors, and his Martyrdom. The chapel immediately behind
the high altar is, as usual, the Lady Chapel. The next contains
a good modern window of the Marriage of the Virgin.
Examine in detail all the windows; one of the mystic wine-press
is very interesting. Votive offerings of the city of Paris to Ste.
Geneviève also exist in the ambulatory. Curious frescoes of
the martyrdom of the 10,000 Christians on Mount Ararat on the
<span style='font-size:smaller'>N</span> side. The best view of the choir is obtained from the <span style='font-size:smaller'>N</span>
side of the ambulatory, opposite the shrine of Ste. Geneviève.
In the north aisle notice St. Louis with the Crown of Thorns.
Stand again in the centre of the nave, near the entrance, and
observe the curious inclination of the choir and high altar to
one side—here particularly noticeable, and said in every case
to represent the droop of the Redeemer’s head on the cross.
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Go out again. As you emerge from the door, observe the
cold and bare side of the Panthéon, contrasted with the internal
richness of St. Étienne. Curious view of the late Gothic portion
of the church from the little Place on the <span style='font-size:smaller'>N</span> side. Return by
the Rue Cujas and Rue St. Jacques, passing the Lycée Ste.
Barbe, Lycée Louis-le-Grand, University, and other scholastic
buildings, which give a good idea of the character of the
quarter.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>[P</span></span>ARIS, which spread rapidly Southward at first, was
somewhat slower in its <span class='bold'>Northward</span> development.
Nevertheless, by the time of Philippe Auguste, the Town
<span class='bold'>La Ville</span>—the commercial portion <span style='font-size:smaller'>N</span> of the river—more than
equalled the learned district on the <span style='font-size:smaller'>S</span> side. This central
northern region, however, containing the Hôtel de Ville, St.
Eustache, and some other important buildings, I purposely
postpone to the consideration of <span class='bold'>the Louvre</span> and its neighbourhood,
which, though later in date, form the heart and
core of Renaissance Paris—the Paris of François I<sup>er</sup> and
his splendour-loving successors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most of the buildings we have hitherto considered are
mediæval and Gothic. The Louvre introduces us at once to a
new world—the world of the <span class='bold'>Renaissance</span>. The transition is
abrupt. In Italy, and especially in Florence, the Renaissance
was <span class='it'>a natural growth</span>; in France it was <span class='sc'>a fashion</span>. It came in,
full-fledged, without history or antecedents. To trace its evolution,
one must follow it out in detail in Florence and Venice.
There, it grows of itself, organically, by gradual stages. But in
France, Gothic churches and mediæval <span class='it'>châteaux</span> give place at
once, with a bound, to developed Renaissance temples and
palaces. The reason for this fact is, that the French kings,
from Charles VIII onward to Henri IV, were thoroughly Italianate.
They fought, travelled, and married in Italy, to parts of
which they laid claim; and being closely allied with the Medici
and other Italian families,—husbands of Medici wives, sons of
Medici mothers,—they introduced at once into France the
developed products of the Italian Renaissance. At the same
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>
time the increased and centralized power of the Crown enabled
them to build magnificent palaces, like the Louvre and Fontainebleau;
and to this artificial impulse is mainly due the sudden
outburst of art in France under François I<sup>er</sup> and his immediate
successors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is impossible to characterize the <span class='bold'>Renaissance</span> in a few
short sentences. In one aspect, it was a return from <span class='bold'>Gothicism</span>
to <span class='bold'>Classical usage</span>, somewhat altered by the new conditions of
life. At first you will probably only notice that in architecture
it substituted round arches for pointed, and introduced square
doors and windows; while in other arts it replaced sacred and
Christian subjects and treatment by mythological and secular.
But, in contrast with mediævalism, it will reveal itself to you by
degrees as essentially <span class='bold'>the dawn of the modern spirit</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Louvre</span> is the noblest monument of the <span class='bold'>French Renaissance</span>.
From the time of St. Louis onward, the French kings
began to live more and more in the northern suburb, the town
of the merchants, which now assumed the name of La Ville, in
contradistinction to the Cité and the Université. Two of their
chief residences here were the Bastille and the Hôtel St. Paul,
both now demolished—one, on the Place so called, the other,
between the Rue St. Antoine and the Quai des Célestins. But
from a very early period they also possessed a <span class='it'>château</span> on the
site of the Louvre, and known by the same name, which
guarded the point where the wall of Philippe Auguste abutted
on the river. François I<sup>er</sup> decided to pull down this picturesque
turreted mediæval castle, erected by Philippe Auguste and
altered by Charles V. He began the construction in its place
of a magnificent Renaissance palace, which has ever since been
in course of erection. Its subsequent growth, however, is best
explained opposite the building itself, where attention can be
duly called to the succession of its salient features. But a visit
to the exterior fabric of the Louvre should be preceded by one
to <span class='bold'>St. Germain l’Auxerrois</span>, the parish church, and practically
the chapel, of the old Louvre, to which it stood in somewhat
the same relation as the Ste. Chapelle to the home of St. Louis.
Note, however, that the church was situated just within the
ancient wall, while the <span class='it'>château</span> lay outside it. The visitor will
doubtless be tolerably familiar by this time with some parts at
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>
least of the exterior of the Louvre; but he will do well to visit
it now <span class='bold'>systematically</span>, in the order here suggested, so as to
gain a clear general idea of its history and meaning.]</p>

</div>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='ch3a'>A. THE FABRIC</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Go along the Rue de Rivoli, past the Palais Royal, till you
reach the Rue du Louvre. Turn down it, with the Louvre on
your right. To your left stands a curious composite building,
with a detached belfry in the centre, and two wings, as it seems,
one on either side. The southernmost wing is the old <span class='bold'>church
of St. Germain l’Auxerrois</span>, the sole remnant of the earliest
Louvre; the northernmost wing is the modern Mairie of the
1st Arrondissement, unhappily intended to “harmonize” with
it. The real result is, that the modern building kills the old
one. The belfry was designed to fill up the gap between the
two. Its effect is disastrous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The church is older than the oldest Louvre. St. Germanus,
Bishop of Auxerre (<span style='font-size:smaller'>A.D.</span> 430), was almost one of the first generation
of Gallic saints, celebrated for his visit to Britain, where
he assisted in gaining the Hallelujah victory over the heathen
invaders. A church on this site is said to have been erected in
his honour as early as the days of Chilperic. Sacked by the
Normans, it was re-erected in something like its present form
in the 12th century, but received many subsequent additions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The beautiful <span class='bold'>porch</span>, which we first examine, is of much later
date, having been added in 1431 by Jean Gaussel, at a time
when the old <span class='it'>château</span> of the Louvre had become one of the
principal residences of the French kings, in order to give
greater dignity, and to afford a covered approach for the royal
worshippers to what was practically their own chapel. It
therefore contains (restored) statues, in niches, relating especially
to the <span class='bold'>royal and local Saints of Paris</span>, whose names are
beneath them:—St. Cloud, the Princess Ste. Clotilde, Ste. Radégonde
of France, St. Denis, St. Marcel, St. Germain himself,
St. Landry, Ste. Isabelle, Ste. Bathilde, St. Jean de Valois, and
others. The saints of the royal house are distinguished by
crowns or coronets. Two of these statues are old: St. Francis,
at the south end, and St. Mary of Egypt, nude, with her long
hair, and the three loaves which sustained her in the desert, on
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>
the second north pillar. The modern frescoes, destroyed, are
by Mottez.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Observe the congruity of all these saints to the church and
the <span class='it'>château</span>. St. Landry or Landeric, an early Frankish bishop
of Paris, was buried within, and his shrine was a place of pilgrimage.
St. Marcel was also a bishop of Paris. St. Cloud
was a holy anchorite whose cell was in the wood which occupied
the site of the palace (now destroyed) that bears his name.
All these saints are therefore closely bound up with the town of
Paris and the royal family. You must never forget this near
alliance in France between the church and the crown: it colours
all the architecture of the early period.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within the porch, we come to the <span class='bold'>main façade</span>, of the 13th
century. R and <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, two sainted bishops of Auxerre, successors
of St. Germain. Central portal, a queen, a king (probably
Childebert and Ultrogothe, the original Frankish founders), St.
Vincent; then St. Germain himself, and Ste. Geneviève, with
the usual devil and candle, and her attendant angel, etc. On the
pier, Madonna and Child, under a canopy. The tympanum had
formerly the usual relief of the Last Judgment, now destroyed,
and replaced by a fresco. Reminiscences of its subject still
remain in the quaint figures to <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> and <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> on the arch, at its base,
representing respectively, with childish realism, the Jaws of
Hell and Abraham’s Bosom, to which the wicked and the just
were consigned in the centre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this church, and in that of St. Germain-des-Prés (see later),
<span class='bold'>St. Vincent</span> ranks as a local Parisian saint, because his tunic
was preserved in the great abbey church of the other St. Germain
beyond the river. He bears a martyr’s palm and is
habited as a deacon; whence he is often hard to distinguish
from his brother deacon, St. Stephen: both are often put
together in Parisian churches. It is probable that St. Germain
of Paris consecrated this church to his older namesake and <span class='bold'>St.
Vincent</span>—for his connection with whom you had better wait till
you visit St. Germain-des-Prés.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>interior</span> is low, but impressive. The <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> aisle is entirely
railed off as a separate church or Lady Chapel. It contains
an interesting 14th-century Root of Jesse, seldom accessible.
Pretty modern font, by Jouffroy, after Mme. de Lamartine,
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>
in the South Transept. Walk round the Ambulatory (behind
the Choir), and observe the stained glass and other details,
which the reader may now be trusted to discover unaided. A
mass of the detail is well worthy of notice. The Gothic pillars
of the Choir were converted in the 18th century into fluted
columns. Over the Sacristy, in the South Ambulatory, is a
modern fresco of St. Germain and St. Vincent. Note many
other memorials of the latter. When you leave, walk to the
south side of the church to inspect the exterior and the <span class='bold'>square
tower</span>, from which, as parish church of the Louvre, the bell
rang for the massacre of St. Bartholomew, to be answered by
that in the Palace on the island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On emerging from the church, contrast its Gothic quaintness
and richness of detail with the cold, classical <span class='it'>façade</span> of that
part of the <span class='bold'>Louvre</span> which fronts you. This <span class='it'>façade</span>, known as
Perrault’s Colonnade, with its classical pediment and Corinthian
columns, was erected by Claude Perrault for Louis XIV,
whose LL and crown appear on every part of it. Nothing
could better illustrate the profound difference between Gothic
and Classical architecture than this abrupt contrast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The portion of the palace that faces you is the real <span class='bold'>front
door</span> of the Louvre. Notice the smaller barred windows on
the ground floor, and the upper story converted into a <span class='it'>loggia</span>.
Now pass in through the <span class='bold'>gateway</span>, under the Chariot of the
Sun—an Apotheosis of Louis—into the First Court, known distinctively
as the <span class='bold'>Cour du Louvre</span>. For all that follows, consult
the excellent coloured map in Baedeker, page 86. I advise
you to cut it out, and carry it round in your hand during this
excursion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Begin by understanding distinctly that this court (le vieux
Louvre) is the real and <span class='bold'>original Louvre</span>: the rest is mere
excrescence, intended to unite the main building with the
Tuileries, which lay some hundreds of yards to the west of it.
Notice, first, that the Palace as a whole, seen from the point
where you now stand, is constructed on the old principle of
relatively blank external walls, like a castle, with an interior
courtyard, on which all the apartments open, and almost all
the decoration is lavished. Reminiscences of defence lurk
about the Louvre. It can best be understood by comparison
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>
with such ornate, yet fortress-like, Italian palaces as the Strozzi
at Florence. Notice the four opposite portals, facing the cardinal
points, which can be readily shut by means of great
doors; while the actual doorways of the various suites of
apartments open only into the protected courtyard. This is
the origin of the familiar French <span class='it'>porte-cochère</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again, the portion of the building that <span class='bold'>directly faces you</span> as
you enter the court from St. Germain is the <span class='bold'>oldest part</span>, and
represents the early Renaissance spirit. It is the most primitive
Louvre. Note in particular the central elevated portion,
known as a <span class='it'>Pavillon</span>, and graced with elegant Caryatides.
These <span class='it'>Pavillons</span> are lingering reminiscences of the mediæval
towers. You will find them in the corners and centres of other
blocks in the Louvre. They form a peculiarly French Renaissance
characteristic. The Palace is here growing out of the
Castle. The other three sides of the square are, on the whole,
more classical and later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now cross the square directly to the <span class='bold'>Pavillon de l’Horloge</span>,
as it is called, from the clock which adorns it. To your <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, on
the floor of the court, are two circular <span class='bold'>white lines</span>, enclosed in
a square. These mark the site of the original <span class='it'>Château</span> of the
Louvre, with its Keep, or <span class='it'>donjon</span>. François I<sup>er</sup>, who began the
existing building, originally intended that his palace should
cover the same area. It was he who erected the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> wing, which
now faces you, marked by the crowned H on its central round
gable, placed there by his successor, Henri II, under whom it
was completed. To the same king are also due the monograms
of H and D (for Diane de Poitiers, his mistress), between the
columns of the ground floor. The whole of the Pavillon de
l’Horloge, and of this west wing, should be <span class='bold'>carefully examined
in detail</span> as the finest remaining specimen of highly
decorated French Renaissance architecture. (But the upper
story of the Pavillon, with the Caryatides, is an age later.) Observe
even the decoration lavished on the beautiful chimneys.
Pierre Lescot was the architect of this earliest wing; the exquisite
sculpture is by Jean Goujon, a Frenchman, and the
Italian, Paolo Ponzio. Examine much of it. The crossed K’s
of certain panels stand for Catherine de Médicis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> wing, beyond the <span class='it'>Pavillon</span>, was added, in the same
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>
style, under Louis XIII, who decided to double the plan of
his predecessors, and form the existing Cour du Louvre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other three sides, in a more classic style, with pediments
replacing the Pavillons, and square porticoes instead of
rounded gables, are for the most part later. The <span style='font-size:smaller'>S</span> side, however,
as far as the central door, is also by Pierre Lescot. It
forms one of the two fronts of the original square first contemplated.
The attic story of these three sides was added under
Louis XIV, to whom in the main is due this Cour du Louvre.
A considerable part of Louis XIV’s decorations bear reference
to his representation as <span class='it'>le roi soleil</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, pass through the Pavillon de l’Horloge (called on its <span style='font-size:smaller'>W</span>
side Pavillon Sully) into the <span class='bold'>second</span> of the three courts of the
Louvre. To understand this portion of the building, again,
you must remember that shortly after the erection of the Old
Louvre, Catherine de Médicis began to build her palace of the
<span class='bold'>Tuileries</span>, now destroyed, to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>W</span> of it. She (and subsequent
rulers) designed to unite the Old Louvre with the Tuileries by a
<span class='bold'>gallery</span> which should run along the bank of the river. Of that
gallery, Catherine de Médicis herself erected a considerable
portion, to be described later, and Henri IV almost completed
it. Later on, Napoleon I conceived the idea of extending a
similar gallery along his new Rue de Rivoli, on the <span style='font-size:smaller'>N</span> side, so
as to enclose the whole space between the Louvre and the
Tuileries in one gigantic double courtyard. Napoleon III
carried out his idea. The <span class='bold'>second court</span> in which you now
stand is entirely flanked by buildings of this epoch—the Second
Empire. Examine it cursorily as far as the modern statue of
Gambetta.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stand or take a seat by the railing of the garden opposite the
Pavillon Sully. The part that now faces you forms a portion of
the building of François I<sup>er</sup> and Louis XIII, re-decorated in part
by Napoleon I. The portions to your <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> and <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> (consult Baedeker’s
map) are entirely of the age of Napoleon III, built so as to
conceal the want of parallelism of the outer portions. Observe
their characteristic Pavillons, each bearing its own name inscribed
upon it. This recent square, though quite modern in
the character of its sculpture and decoration, is Renaissance
in its general architecture, and, when looked back upon from
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>
the gardens of the Tuileries, affords a most excellent idea of
that stately style, as developed in France under François I<sup>er</sup>.
The whole of this splendid plan, however, has been rendered
futile by the destruction of the Tuileries, without which the
enclosure becomes wholly meaningless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, continue <span class='bold'>westward,</span> pass the Monument of Gambetta,
and take a seat on the steps at the base, near the fine nude
figure of Truth. In front of you opens the <span class='bold'>third square</span> of
the Louvre, known as the <span class='bold'>Place du Carrousel</span>, and formerly
enclosed on its <span style='font-size:smaller'>W</span> side by the Palace of the Tuileries, which was
unfortunately burnt down in 1871, during the conflict between
the Municipal and National authorities. Its place is now occupied
by a garden terrace, the view from which in all directions
is magnificent. Fronting you, as you sit, is the <span class='bold'>Arc de
Triomphe du Carrousel</span>, erected under Napoleon I, by
Percier and Fontaine, in imitation of the Arch of Septimius
Severus at Rome, and once crowned by the famous bronze
Roman horses from St. Mark’s at Venice. The arch, designed
as an approach to the Tuileries during the period of the classical
mania, is too small for its present surroundings, since the
removal of the Palace. The <span class='bold'>N. wing</span>, visible to your <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, is
purely modern, of the age of the First and Second Empire and
the Third Republic. The meretricious character of the reliefs
in its extreme <span style='font-size:smaller'>W.</span> portion, erected under the Emperor Napoleon
III, and restored after the Commune, is redolent of the spirit
of that gaudy period. The <span class='bold'>S. wing</span>, to your <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, forms part of
the <span class='bold'>connecting gallery</span> erected by Henri IV, but its architecture
is largely obscured by considerable alterations under
Napoleon III. Its <span style='font-size:smaller'>W</span> pavillon—known as the Pavillon de
Flore—is well worth notice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having thus gained a first idea of the <span class='bold'>courtyard fronts</span> of
the building, continue your walk, still westward, along the <span style='font-size:smaller'>S</span>
wing as far as the Pavillon de Flore, a remaining portion of the
corner edifice which ran into one line with the Palace of the
Tuileries (again consult Baedeker’s map). Turn round the
corner of the Pavillon to examine the <span style='font-size:smaller'>S</span>, or <span class='bold'>River Front</span> of the
connecting gallery—one of the finest parts of the whole building,
but far less known to ordinary visitors than the cold and
uninteresting Northern line along the Rue de Rivoli. The first
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>
portion, as far as the gateways, belongs originally to the age of
Henri IV; but it was entirely reconstructed under Napoleon
III, whose obtrusive <span style='font-size:smaller'>N</span> appears in many places on the gateways
and elsewhere. Nevertheless, it still preserves, on the whole,
some reminiscence of its graceful Renaissance architecture.
Beyond the main gateway (with modern bronze Charioteer of
the Sun), flanked by the Pavillons de la Trémoille and de
Lesdiguières, we come upon the long <span class='bold'>Southern Gallery</span>
erected by Catherine de Médicis, which still preserves almost
intact its splendid early French Renaissance decoration. This
is one of the noblest portions of the entire building. The <span style='font-size:smaller'>N</span>
here gives place to H’s, and the Renaissance scroll-work and
reliefs almost equal those in that portion of the old Louvre
which was erected under François I<sup>er</sup>. Sit on a seat on the
Quay and examine the sculpture. Notice particularly the
splendid Porte Jean Goujon, conspicuous from afar by its gilded
balcony. Its crowned H’s and coats-of-arms are specially
interesting examples of the decorative work of the period.
Note also the skill with which this almost flat range is relieved
by sculpture and decoration so as to make us oblivious of the
want of that variety usually given by jutting portions. The end
of this long gallery is formed by two handsome windows with
balconies. We there come to the connecting <span class='bold'>Galerie d’Apollon</span>,
of which these windows are the termination, and
finally reach once more a portion of Perrault’s façade, with its
double LL’s, erected under Louis XIV, and closely resembling
the interior <span class='it'>façade</span> of the Cour du Louvre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(The <span style='font-size:smaller'>N</span> side you can examine any day as you pass along the
Rue de Rivoli. You will now have no difficulty in distinguishing
its various factors—first, on the <span style='font-size:smaller'>E</span>, a part of Perrault’s <span class='it'>façade</span>
of the Old Louvre; then, where it begins to bend outward, a
portion of Napoleon the Third’s connecting link; finally,
beyond the main carriage way, westward, a part reconstructed
under the Third Republic.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sit awhile on the adjacent Pont des Arts to gain a general
conception of the relations of the Louvre, the Île de la Cité,
the Hôtel de Ville and other surrounding buildings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This first rough idea of the Louvre should be filled in later
by detailed study. The Renaissance portions, in particular,
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>
you should look at again and again, every time you enter
piecing out your conceptions at a later stage by visiting the
Renaissance Sculpture Gallery in the Cour du Louvre, and
comparing the works inside it and outside it. Thus only can
you gain a connected idea of Renaissance Paris, to be further
supplemented by frequent visits to St. Étienne-du-Mont, St.
Eustache, and Fontainebleau.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='ch3b'>B. THE COLLECTIONS</h2>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>[The Collections in the Louvre have no such necessary organic
connection with Paris itself as Notre-Dame and the
Sainte-Chapelle, or even those in the rooms at Cluny. They
may, therefore, be examined by the visitor at <span class='it'>any</span> period of his
visit that he chooses. I would advise him, however, whenever
he takes them up, to begin with the paintings, <span class='it'>in the order here
enumerated</span>, and then to go on to the Classical and Renaissance
Sculpture. The last-named, at least, he should only
examine in connection with the rest of Renaissance Paris.
Also, while it is unimportant whether he takes first Painting or
Sculpture, it is very important that he should take each separately
in the <span class='bold'>chronological order</span> here enumerated. He
should not skip from room to room, hap-hazard, but see what
he sees systematically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At least <span class='bold'>six days</span>—far more, if possible—should be devoted
to the Louvre Collections—by far the most important objects to
be seen in Paris. Of these, <span class='bold'>four</span> should be assigned to the
Paintings, and one each to the Classical and Renaissance
Sculpture. If this is impossible, do not try to see all; see a
<span class='bold'>little thoroughly</span>. Confine yourself, for Painting, to the Salon
Carré and the Salle des Primitifs, and for Sculpture, to a hasty
walk through the Classical Gallery and to the three Western
rooms of the Renaissance collection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The object of the hints which follow is <span class='it'>not to describe</span> the
Collections in the Louvre; it is to put the reader <span class='bold'>on the right
track</span> for understanding and enjoying them. It is impossible to
make people admire beautiful things; but if you begin by trying
to comprehend them, you will find admiration and sympathy
grow with comprehension. <span class='bold'>Religious symbolism is the
native language of early art</span>, and you cannot expect to understand
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>
the art if you do not take the trouble to learn the language
in which it is written. Therefore, do not walk listlessly
through the galleries, with a glance, right or left, at what happens
to catch your eye; begin at the beginning, work systematically
through what parts you choose, and endeavour to
grasp the sequence and evolution of each group separately.
Stand or sit long before every work, till you feel you know it;
and return frequently. Remember, too, that I do not point out
always what is most worthy of notice, but rather suggest a mode
of arriving at facts which might otherwise escape you. Many
beautiful objects explain themselves, or fall so naturally into
their proper place in a series that you will readily discover their
meaning and importance without external aid. With others,
you may need a little help, to suggest a point of view, and that
is all that these brief notes aim at. Do not be surprised if I
pass by many beautiful and interesting things; if you find them
out for yourself, there is no need to enlarge upon them.
Should these hints succeed in interesting you in the succession
and development of art, get Mrs. Jameson and Kugler, and
read up at leisure in your rooms all questions suggested to you
by your visits to the galleries. My notes are intended to be
looked at <span class='bold'>before the objects themselves</span>, and merely to open
a door to their right comprehension.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The galleries are open, free, daily, except Mondays. Painting
from 9, Sculpture from 11. For details, see Baedeker.]</p>

</div>

<h3 id='ch3b-1'>I. PAINTINGS.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Take Baedeker’s Plan of the Galleries (1st Floor) with you.
Enter by the door in the Pavillon Denon. (Sticks and umbrellas
left here; tip optional.) Turn to <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> and traverse long
hall with reproductions of famous antiques in bronze (Laocoon,
Medici Venus, Apollo Belvedere, etc.), which those who do
not intend to visit Rome and Florence will do well to examine.
Observe, in passing, in the centre of the hall, a fine antique
sarcophagus, with figures in high relief, representing the story
of Achilles. Begin on the furthest side of the sarcophagus: (1)
Achilles, disguised as a woman, among the daughters of Lycomedes,
in order to avoid the Trojan war; (2) is discovered by
Ulysses as a pedlar, through his choice of arms instead of trinkets;
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>
(3) arming himself for the combat; and (4, modern) Priam
redeeming the body of Hector. (The work originally stood
against a wall, and had therefore three decorative sides only.)
Further on, fine sarcophagus from Salonica, Roman period, with
Combat of Amazons, representing on the lid husband and wife,
couched, somewhat after the Etruscan fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mount the staircase (Escalier Daru). Near the top is the
famous Nikè of Samothrace, a much-mutilated winged figure
of Victory, standing like a figure-head on the prow of a trireme.
It was erected by Demetrius Poliorcetes, in commemoration of
a naval engagement in <span style='font-size:smaller'>B.C.</span> 305. Attitude and drapery stamp
the work as one of the finest products of Hellenic art. Victory
alights on the vessel of the conqueror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turn to your <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> just before reaching the last flight, and pass
several Etruscan sarcophagi and sarcophagus-shaped funereal
urns, many with the deceased and his wife on the lid, accompanied
in some cases by protecting genii. The early Etruscans
buried; the later often burned their dead, but continued to
enclose the ashes in miniature sarcophagi. At the top, on the
<span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, a fresco by <span class='it'>Fra Angelico</span>, the Dominican painter, St.
Dominic embracing the Cross, with the Madonna and St. John
Evangelist: not a first-rate example of the master. End wall, <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>
of door, a fresco by <span class='it'>Botticelli</span>, Giovanni Tornabuoni receiving
the Muses. Opposite it, <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> of door, another by the same,
Giovanna his wife receiving the Graces, and accompanied by
Cupid. These two frescoes stood in the hall of the owner’s
villa, and gracefully typify the husband entertaining Literature,
Science, and Art, while the wife extends hospitality to Love,
Youth, and Beauty. Descend one flight of staircase again,
passing yet other Etruscan sarcophagi (which examine), and,
mounting opposite stairs, pass the Nikè and turn to your <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>.
Traverse the photograph-room and the Salle Duchâtel beyond
it, as well as the Salon Carré. Enter the Long Gallery, and,
taking the first door to your <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, you arrive at once in Room I
(Baedeker’s VII), the</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-variant:small-caps;'>Salle des Primitifs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pictures in this room consist for the most part of those
by early followers of Giotto, and by members of the schools
which sprang from him, till the moment of the Renaissance.
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>
As these earliest pictures strike the key-note of types, continued
and developed later, it is absolutely necessary to examine them
<span class='it'>all</span> very closely. In most cases, subject and treatment were
rigorously prescribed by custom; scenes recur again and
again, almost identically. Where saints are grouped round the
Madonna, they were <span class='it'>ordered</span> by the purchaser, and oftenest
represent his own patrons. In order to obtain a chronological
view, begin at the centre of the end wall. Most of these
pictures are altar-pieces. I follow the <span class='bold'>small numbers below</span>,
the only ones for which a detailed catalogue is yet published.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>*</span>153. <span class='it'>Cimabue</span> (the point of departure for Tuscan art);
Madonna and Child with six angels. Almost a replica of the
great picture in Santa Maria Novella at Florence; gold
ground; the Madonna’s face still strongly Byzantine in type,
with almond-shaped eyes; the Child, draped, after the earlier
fashion. Later, he is represented nude. Observe, however,
the greater artistic freedom in the treatment of the attendant
angels, where Cimabue was slightly less hampered by conventional
precedents. Do not despise this picture because of
its stiffness and its archaic style. It is an immense advance
upon the extremely wooden Byzantine models which preceded
it: and in the angels it really approaches correctness of
drawing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>225. (Skied) <span class='it'>Don Lorenzo Monaco.</span> A Tabernacle for an
altar of St. Lawrence; centre, St. Lawrence, enthroned on his
gridiron; <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, St. Agnes with her lamb; R, St. Margaret with her
dragon, all on gold grounds. A poor example. This Saint is
usually represented in deacon’s robes. The other saints are
probably those who shared the chapel with him. See the much
later St. Margaret by Raphael as an example of Renaissance
treatment of the same figure.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>*</span>192. <span class='it'>Giotto.</span> St. Francis receiving the Stigmata. A genuine
picture, painted for the saint’s own church of San Francesco at
Pisa; one of the earliest representations of this subject, often
afterwards copied. Christ, as a six-winged seraph, red-feathered,
appears in heaven to the Saint; rays proceed from
his five wounds to the hands, feet, and side of St. Francis,
which they impress with similar marks. A mountain represents
La Vernia; two tiny buildings, the monastery. Compare
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>
with this subject two smaller treatments in the same room, both
on the lowest tier: one, to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> as you go towards the door,
431, of the school of Perugino, where an attendant Brother
(Leo) is seen astonished at the vision; the second on the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>,
287, attributed to Pesello, and closely similar in treatment.
Careful comparison of these pictures will serve to show the
close way in which early painters imitated, or almost copied
one another. The base (or predella) of the Giotto also contains
three other subjects: Innocent III, asleep, is shown by St.
Peter the falling church sustained by St. Francis; he confirms
the Franciscan order; St. Francis preaches to the birds. All
very spirited. Notice these little pictures for comparison later
with others painted in the Dominican interest by Fra Angelico.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Continuing along <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> wall are some small pictures of the
Sienese school, which should be carefully examined. (Do not
suppose that because I do not call attention to a picture it is
necessarily unworthy of notice.) Most of these little works
breathe the pure piety and ecstatic feeling of the School of
Siena.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>**</span>426. <span class='it'>Perugino.</span> Tondo, or round picture; the Madonna
Enthroned; <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, St. Rose with her roses; <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, St. Catherine with
her palm of martyrdom; behind, adoring angels. An exquisite
example of the affected tenderness, delicate grace, and brilliant
colouring of the Umbrian master, from whose school Raphael
proceeded. An early specimen. Observe the dainty painting
of the feet and hands, which is highly characteristic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beneath it, 1701, <span class='it'>Gentile da Fabriano</span>. Presentation in the
Temple. Look closely into it. A delicate little example of the
Umbrian rival of Fra Angelico. The arrangement will explain
many later ones. Every one of the figures and their attitudes
are conventional.</p>

<p class='pindent'>427. <span class='it'>Perugino.</span> Madonna and Child, with St. John Baptist
and St. Catherine. The introduction of St. John shows the
picture to have been probably painted for a Florentine patron.
Not a pleasing example.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beneath it, <span class='it'>Vittore Pisano</span>, characteristic portrait of an Este
princess, in the hard, dry, accurate manner of this Veronese
medallist, who borrowed from his earlier art the habit of painting
profiles in strong low relief, with a plastic effect.
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Perugino.</span> St. Sebastian. One of the loveliest examples of
the Umbrian master’s later manner. Contrasted with the
Madonna and St. Rose it shows the distance covered by art
during the painter’s lifetime. Observe its greater freedom and
knowledge of anatomy. St. Sebastian, bound as usual to a
pillar in a ruined temple, is pierced through with arrows.
Face, figure, and expression are unusually fine for Perugino.
Sebastian was the great saint for protection against the plague,
and pictures containing him are almost always votive offerings
under fear of that pestilence. Many in this gallery. The face
here is finer than in any other presentation I know, except
Sodoma’s in the Uffizi at Florence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>258. <span class='it'>Lombard or Piedmontese School.</span> Annunciation. An
unusual treatment; the Madonna, as always, kneels at a <span class='it'>prie-dieu</span>,
and starts away, alarmed and timid, at the apparition of
the angel Gabriel. The action, as usual, takes place in a
<span class='it'>loggia</span>, but the angel is represented as descending <span class='it'>in flight</span>
through the air, an extremely uncommon mode of depicting
him. He bears the white lily of the Annunciation. The other
details are conventional. Contrast with this subsequent Annunciations
in this Gallery. L, are St. Augustin and St. Jerome;
<span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, St. Stephen, bearing on his head, as often, the stones of
his martyrdom, accompanied by St. Peter Martyr the Dominican,
with the knife in his head. Both saints carry palms
of martyrdom. A good picture in a hard, dry, local manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now cross over to the <span class='bold'>opposite side</span> of the room, beginning
at the bottom, in order to preserve the chronological sequence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>196. <span class='it'>School of Giotto.</span> Madonna in Glory, with angels.
Compare this treatment carefully with Cimabue’s great picture
close by, in order to notice the advance in art made in the
interval. The subject and general arrangement are the same,
but observe the irregularity in the placing of the angels, and
the increased knowledge of anatomy and expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Close by are several other <span class='bold'>Giottesque pictures</span>, all of which
should be closely examined; especially 425, <span class='it'>Vanni</span>, the same
subject, for comparison. The little Giottesque Death of St.
Bernard, in particular, is a characteristic example or type of a
group which deals in the same manner with saintly obsequies.
All of them will suggest explanations of later pictures. In all
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>
these cases, the saint lies on a bier in the foreground, surrounded
by mourning monks and ecclesiastics. The key-note
was struck by Giotto’s fresco of the Death of St. Francis at
Santa Croce in Florence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>187. <span class='it'>Agnolo Gaddi.</span> Annunciation; a characteristic example.
Note the loggia, and the angel with the lily; the
introduction of a second angel, however, is a rare variation
from the type. In the corner is the Father despatching the
Holy Spirit. Attitude of the Madonna characteristic; study
carefully. No subject sheds more light on the methods of
early art than the Annunciation. It always takes place in an
arcade: the Madonna is almost always to the right of the
picture: and <span class='it'>prie-dieu</span>, book, and bed are frequent accessories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>666. Quaint little Florentine picture of St. Nicolas, throwing
three purses of gold as a dowry inside the house of a poor and
starving nobleman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next to it, unnumbered, Gregory the Great sees the Angel of
the Plague sheathing his sword on the Castle of St. Angelo, so
called from this vision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>494. St. Jerome in the Desert; lion, skull, crucifix, rocks,
cardinal’s hat, all characteristic of the subject. In the foreground,
a Florentine lily; in the background, Christ and the
infant Baptist, patron of Florence; background <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, St. Augustine
and the angel who tries to empty the sea into a hole made
with a bucket—a well-known allegory of the attempt of the
finite to comprehend the Infinite. Look out elsewhere for such
minor episodes.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Fra Angelico.</span> Martyrdom of Sts. Cosmo and Damian, the
holy physicians and (therefore) patron saints of the Medici
family; a characteristic example of the saintly friar’s colouring
in small subjects. These two Medici saints are naturally
frequent in Florentine art.</p>

<p class='pindent'>662. <span class='it'>Fra Angelico.</span> Story of the death of St. John Baptist.
Three successive episodes represented in the same picture.
The lithe figure of the daughter of Herodias, dancing, is very
characteristic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>166. Battle scene, by <span class='it'>Paolo Uccello</span>. Showing vigorous
efforts at mastery of perspective and foreshortening, as yet but
partially successful. The wooden character of the horses is
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>
conspicuous. Paolo Uccello was one of the group of early
scientific artists, who endeavoured to improve their knowledge
of optics and of the sciences ancillary to painting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>199. <span class='it'>Benozzo Gozzoli.</span> Glory of St. Thomas Aquinas, the
great <span class='bold'>Dominican</span> teacher. This is an apotheosis of scholasticism,
in the person of its chief representative. R and <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> stand
Aristotle and Plato, the heathen philosophers, in deferential
attitudes, recognising their master. Beneath his feet is Guillaume
de St. Amour, a vanquished heretic. Below, the entire
Church—pope, cardinals, doctors—receiving instruction from
St. Thomas. Above, the Eternal Father signifying His approval
in a Latin inscription, surrounded by the Evangelists
with their symbols—angel, winged lion, bull, eagle. The inscription
imports, “Thomas has well spoken of Me.” The
style is archaic: the council is supposed to be that of Agnani,
presided over by Pope Alexander IV. Among the celestial
personages, notice St. Paul, Moses, and others. Pictures of
this double sort, embracing scenes in heaven and on earth, are
common in Italy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beneath it (287), part 2. <span class='it'>Pesello.</span> St. Cosmo and St. Damian
affixing the leg of a dead Moor to a wounded Christian, on
whom they have been compelled to practise amputation. The
costumes are the conventional ones for these saints. Remember
them. This astounding miracle is often represented at
Florence: the dead man’s leg grew on the living one.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>**</span>182. <span class='it'>Fra Angelico.</span> A Coronation of the Virgin, painted for
a <span class='bold'>Dominican</span> church at Fiesole. In the foreground, St. Louis
of France, with a crown of fleur-de-lis; St. Zenobius, Bishop of
Florence, with the lamb of the Baptist on his crosier (indicating
his see); St. Mary Magdalen, in red, with long yellow hair (so
almost always), and (her symbol) the box of ointment; St.
Catherine with her wheel; St. Agnes with her lamb, and others.
Above St. Louis stands St. Dominic, founder of Fra Angelico’s
order, recognisable by his robes, with his red star and white
lily (the usual attributes); beneath him, a little to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, St.
Thomas Aquinas, with a book sending forth rays of light, to
signify his teaching function. Near him, St. Francis. Other
Saints, such as St. Lawrence with his gridiron, and St. Peter
Martyr, the Dominican, with his wounded head, must be left to
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>
the spectator. In the background, choirs of angels. Beneath,
in the <span class='bold'>predella</span>, the history of <span class='bold'>St. Dominic</span> (marked by a red
star); Pope Innocent in a dream sees him sustaining the falling
Church (a Dominican variant of the story of St. Francis in the
Giotto, at the end): he receives his commission from St. Peter
and St. Paul; he restores to life the young man Napoleon, killed
by a fall from a horse (seen to left); he converts heretics and
burns their books; he is fed with his brethren by angels in his
convent at Rome; and his death and apotheosis. This picture
deserves most careful study—say two hours. It is one of Fra
Angelico’s finest easel paintings (his best are frescoes), and it
is full of interest for its glorification of the Dominicans. Compare
the St. Thomas Aquinas with Benozzo Gozzoli’s: and
remember in studying the predella that St. Dominic founded
the Inquisition. The tender painting of this lovely work needs
no commendation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>222. <span class='it'>School of Filippo Lippi.</span> Madonna and angels, characteristic
of the type of this painter and his followers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above it, <span class='it'>Neri di Bicci</span>. Madonna, very wooden. He was a
belated Giottesque, who turned out such antiquated types by
hundreds in the 15th century.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>School of Benozzo Gozzoli.</span> Madonna and Child. L, St.
Cosmo and St. Damian, with pens and surgeons’ boxes; St.
Jerome, with stone, lion, and cardinal’s hat; his pen and book
denote him as translator of the Vulgate. R, St. John Baptist
(representing Florence); St. Francis with the Stigmata; St.
Lawrence. The combination of Saints shows the picture to
have been painted in compliment to Lorenzo de’ Medici. Minor
subjects around it are worthy of study.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now <span class='bold'>cross over the room</span> again. You come at once upon
four pictures of nearly the same size, painted for the Court of
the Gonzaga family at Mantua. Allegorical subjects, intended for
the decoration of a hall or boudoir. Most of those pictures we
have hitherto examined have been sacred: we now get an
indication of the nascent Renaissance taste for myth and
allegory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>429. <span class='it'>Perugino.</span> Combat of Love and Chastity. A frequent
subject for such situations, showing Perugino at his worst.
Compare it with the other three of the series.
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>253. <span class='it'>Mantegna.</span> Wisdom conquering the Vices. A characteristic
but unpleasing example of this great Paduan painter.
Admirable in anatomy, drawing, and perspective: poor in effect.
Observe the festoons in the background, which are favourites
with the artist and his school.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>*</span>252. <span class='it'>Mantegna.</span> The amours of Mars and Venus discovered
by (her husband) Vulcan. A beautiful composition.
The guilty pair, with a couch, stand on a mountain, representing
Parnassus, accompanied by Cupid. Below, exquisite group
of the Nine Muses dancing (afterwards imitated by Guido).
To the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, Apollo with his lyre, as musician. R, Mercury and
Pegasus. In the background, the injured Vulcan discovering
the lovers. This splendid specimen of early Renaissance art
is one of Mantegna’s finest. Study it in detail, and compare
with the other three which it accompanies. Observe the life
and movement in the dancing Muses: also, the growing
Renaissance love for the nude, exemplified in the Venus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>154. <span class='it'>Costa.</span> The Court of Isabella d’Este. The meaning of
the figures is now undecipherable, but the general character
indicates peace, and devotion to literature, science and art. A
fine example of the Ferrarese master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Between these four, <span class='bold'>**</span><span class='it'>Mantegna</span>; (251), Madonna della Vittoria,
a most characteristic picture, painted for Giovanni
Francesco Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua, to commemorate his
victory over Charles VIII of France. The Madonna is enthroned
under a most characteristic canopy of fruit and flowers,
with pendents of coral and other decorative adjuncts. L, Gonzaga
himself, kneeling in gratitude—a ruffianly face, well-painted.
<span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, St. Elizabeth, mother of the Baptist, with St. John Baptist
himself, representing the Marquis’s wife. Behind, the patron
Saints of Mantua, who assisted in the victory: St. Michael the
Archangel (the warrior saint—a most noble figure), St. Andrew
(Mantegna’s name-Saint), St. Longinus, who pierced the side of
Christ, and St. George. The whole is exquisitely beautiful.
The detail deserves long and attentive study. The reliefs on
the pedestal are characteristic. From the church of the same
name, erected in commemoration of the victory (of the Taro).
I will return hereafter at greater length to this lovely picture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above, to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> (<span class='bold'>*</span>418), <span class='it'>Cosimo Tura</span>. Pietà, or body of Christ
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>
wept over by the Madonna and angels. In drawing and colouring,
a characteristic example of this harsh, but very original
and powerful, Ferrarese master. You will come hereafter on
many Pietàs. Compare them all, and note the attitude and
functions of the angels.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Cross over again</span> to the opposite side. (183), <span class='it'>Botticelli</span>.
Round Madonna and angels, very characteristic as to the drawing,
but inferior in technique to most of his works.</p>

<p class='pindent'>221. <span class='it'>Filippo Lippi.</span> Madonna in Glory, with angels. The
roundness of the faces, especially in the child angels, is very
characteristic. At her feet, two Florentine patron saints. The
absence of symbols makes them difficult to identify, but I think
they represent St. Zenobius and St. Antonine. Very fine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>184. <span class='it'>Botticelli.</span> Madonna and Child, with St. John of
Florence. The wistful expressions strike the key-note of this
painter. Compare with nameless Florentine Madonna of the
same school above it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>220. <span class='it'>Fra Filippo Lippi.</span> Nativity. Worthy of careful study,
especially for the accessories: St. Joseph, the stall and bottle,
the saddle, ox and ass, and wattles, ruined temple, etc., which reappear
in many similar pictures. Not a favourable example of
the master. Beneath it, little fragments with St. Peter Martyr,
Visitation, Christ and Magdalen, meeting of Francis and Dominic,
and St. Paul the Hermit. An odd conglomeration, whose
meaning cannot now be deciphered. The ruined temple, frequently
seen in Nativities and Adorations of the Magi, typifies
the downfall of Paganism before the advance of Christianity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beside it, <span class='it'>Ghirlandajo</span>. Portrait of bottle-nosed man and
child. Admirable and characteristic.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>**</span>202. <span class='it'>Ghirlandajo.</span> Visitation. Probably the master’s finest
easel picture. Splendid colour. Attitudes of the Madonna
and St. Elizabeth characteristic of the type. The scene habitually
takes place in front of a portal, as here, with the heads of
the main actors more or less silhouetted against the arch in the
background. At the sides, Mary Salome, and “the other
Mary.” Such saints are introduced merely as spectators: they
need not even be contemporary: they are included in purely
ideal groupings. At Florence, in a similar scene, the as yet
unborn St. John the Baptist stands by as an assessor.
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>185. Venus and Cupid, of the school of <span class='it'>Botticelli</span>. Very
pleasing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>347. <span class='it'>Cosimo Rosselli.</span> Madonna in an almond-shaped glory
(Mandorla) of red and blue cherubs. L, the Magdalen; <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, St.
Bernard, to whom she appeared, writing down his vision; about,
adoring angels. A characteristic example of this harsh Florentine
painter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>156. We come at once upon the High Renaissance in <span class='it'>Lorenzo
di Credi’s</span> beautiful Virgin and Child, flanked by St. Julian and
St. Nicholas. Observe the three balls of gold in the corner by
the latter’s feet, representative of the three purses thrown to
the nobleman’s daughters. Notice also the Renaissance architecture
and decorations. In pictures of this class, the saints to
accompany the Madonna were <span class='it'>ordered</span> by the person giving the
commission; the artist could only exercise his discretion as to
the grouping. Notice how this varies with the advance of the
Renaissance: at first stiffly placed in pairs, the saints finally
form a group with characteristic action. The execution of this
lovely work shows Lorenzo as one of the finest artists of his
period.</p>

<p class='pindent'>70. <span class='it'>Bianchi</span>, a rare Ferrarese master. Madonna enthroned,
with Saints. The angel on the step is characteristically Ferrarese,
as are also the reliefs and architecture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>467. Ascetic figure of San Giovanni di Capistrano.</p>

<p class='pindent'>435. <span class='it'>School of Perugino.</span> Little Madonna, in an almond-shaped
glory of cherubs. The shape belongs to Christ, or
saints, ascending into glory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next it, front of a chest, containing the story of Europa
and the Bull. Several episodes are combined in a single
picture. To the extreme <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, the transformed lover, like the
prince in a fairy tale. Most gracefully treated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>61. <span class='it'>Bellini.</span> Madonna and Child, between St. Peter and St.
Sebastian; a plague picture. These half-length Madonnas are
very characteristic of Venetian art of the period. The Madonna’s
face and strong neck also very Venetian. Observe them
as the type on which Titian’s are modelled. Look long at this
soft and melting picture. The gentle noble face, the dainty
dress, the beautiful painting of the nude in the St. Sebastian,
are all redolent of the finest age of Venetian painting.
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Above it, a good <span class='it'>Tura</span>. Compare with previous one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>60. <span class='it'>School of Gentile Bellini.</span> Venetian ambassador received
at Cairo. Oriental tinge frequent at Venice. This gate
can still be recognised at Cairo. The figures are all portraits,
and the painter probably accompanied the ambassador,
Domenico Trevisano.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beneath it (59), two fine portraits by <span class='it'>Gentile Bellini</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>664. Characteristic little <span class='it'>Montagna</span>; angels at the base of a
Madonna now destroyed. Compare the Bianchi almost opposite.
Such angels are frequent in the school of Bellini.</p>

<p class='pindent'>152. Attributed to <span class='it'>Cima</span>. Madonna Enthroned, with St. John
Baptist and the Magdalen. These lofty thrones and landscape
backgrounds of the Friuli country are frequent with Cima and
Venetian painters of his period.</p>

<p class='pindent'>113. <span class='it'>Carpaccio.</span> Preaching of St. Stephen. One of a series
of the Life of St. Stephen, now scattered. The saint is in
deacon’s robes, as usual; oriental costumes mark the intercourse
of Venice with the East. Observe the architecture, a
graceful compound of Venetian and oriental.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over the doorway, Fresco of God the Father, in an almond-shaped
glory, from the Villa Magliana. Purchased as a
Raphael, probably by <span class='it'>Lo Spagna</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Return frequently to this room, and study it deeply. It will
give you the key to all the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now traverse the Salon Carré and enter the</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-variant:small-caps;'>Salle Duchâtel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> wall are two exquisite frescoes by <span class='it'>Luini</span>, removed
entire from walls in Milan. To the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, the Adoration of the
Magi, exquisitely tender and graceful; study it closely as an
example both of painter and subject, noting the ages and attitudes
of the Three Kings, the youngest (as usual) a Moor, and
the exquisite face and form of the Madonna. To the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, a
Nativity, equally characteristic. Look long at them. Between,
Christ blessing, not quite so beautiful; and Genii with
grapes, an antique motive. Above are three other frescoes
of the school of Luini, not so fine. Centre, Annunciation, the
Madonna separated (as often) from the angel by a lily. The
Madonna never approaches the angel, and is usually divided by
a wall or barrier.
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>On the screen by door, good portraits by <span class='it'>Antonio Moro</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other side of door (680), Madonna and Child, with the
donors of the picture, by <span class='it'>Hans Memling</span>. This beautiful
<span class='bold'>Flemish</span> picture well represents the characteristics of Flemish
as opposed to Italian art. Notice the want of ideality in the
Virgin and Child, contrasted with the admirable portraiture of
the donors, the chief of whom is introduced by his namesake,
St. James, recognisable by his staff and scallop-shell. The
female donors, several of whom are Dominican nuns, are
similarly introduced by their founder, St. Dominic, whose
black-and-white robes and star-like halo serve to identify him.
Observe the exquisite finish of the hair and all the details.
Study this work for the Flemish spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the far end of the room are two pictures by <span class='it'>Ingres</span>,
marking the interval covered by French art during the lifetime
of that great painter. L, Œdipus and the Sphinx, produced
in the classical period of the master’s youth, while he
was still under the malign influence of David. R, La Source,
perhaps the most exquisitely virginal delineation of the nude
ever achieved in painting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After having traversed these two rooms the spectator will
probably be able to attack the</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-variant:small-caps;'>Salon Carré,</p>

<p class='noindent'>which contains what are considered by the authorities as the
gems of the collection, irrespective of period or country (a very
regrettable jumble). Almost all of them, therefore, deserve
attention. I shall direct notice here chiefly to those which
require some <span class='bold'>explanation</span>. Begin to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> of the door which
leads from the Salle Duchâtel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Close to the door, Apollo and Marsyas: a delicate little
<span class='it'>Perugino</span>, attributed to Raphael. Good treatment of the
nude, and painted like a miniature. Renaissance feeling.
Compare it with the St. Sebastian in the Salle des Primitifs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above it, <span class='it'>Jehan de Paris</span>. Madonna and Child, with the
donors; a characteristic and exceptionally beautiful example of
the <span class='bold'>early French school</span>. Contrast its character with the
Italian and Flemish. Extremely regal and fond of tinsel
ornament.
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>20. <span class='it'>Correggio.</span> Jupiter and Antiope, a good example of his
Correggiosity and marvellous arrangement of light and shade.
Very late Renaissance. Perfection of art; very little feeling.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>*</span>446. <span class='it'>Titian.</span> Entombment. A fine but faded example of
the colour and treatment of the prince of the Venetian Renaissance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>231. <span class='it'>Luini.</span> Virgin and Child. Not a pleasing example.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>*</span>419 and <span class='bold'>**</span>417. Two admirable portraits by <span class='it'>Rembrandt</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>**</span>250. <span class='it'>Mantegna.</span> Crucifixion, predella or base of the great
picture in San Zeno at Verona. Notice the admirable antique
character of the soldiers casting lots for Christ’s raiment. The
rocks are very Mantegnesque in treatment. One of the artist’s
finest pictures. Spend some time before it. We will return
again to this fine painting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>381. <span class='it'>Andrea del Sarto.</span> Holy Family. Showing well the
character of this master’s tender and melting colour: also, the
altered Renaissance treatment of the subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond the doorway, two dainty little <span class='it'>Memlings</span>. Marriage
of St. Catherine (the Alexandrian princess) to the Infant Christ;
and, the Donor with St. John Baptist and his lamb. When a
saint places his hand on a votary’s shoulder, it usually indicates
the patron whose name the votary bears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near it, graceful little St. Sebastian of the Umbrian school.
Compare with others. This plague-saint is one of the few to
whom mediæval piety permitted nudity.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>*</span>370. <span class='it'>Raphael.</span> The great St. Michael, painted for François
I<sup>er</sup>. Admirable in its instantaneous dramatic action. This picture
may be taken, in its spirit and vigour, as marking the culminating
point of the Italian Renaissance as here represented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near it, <span class='it'>Titian</span>. The Man with the Glove: a fine portrait.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>**</span>19. <span class='it'>Correggio.</span> The Marriage of St. Catherine. This is a
characteristic treatment, by the great painter of Parma, of this
mystical subject. St. Catherine is treated as an Italian
princess of his own time, on whose finger the infant Christ
playfully places a ring. The action has absolutely no mystic
solemnity. Behind, stands St. Sebastian, with his arrows to
mark him (without them you would not know him from a
classical figure), looking on with amused attention. His smile
is lovely. In the background, episodes of the martyrdom of
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>
St. Sebastian, proving this to be probably a plague picture.
But the whole work, though admirable as art, has in it nothing
of religion, and may be aptly compared as to tone with the
Education of Cupid by the same artist in the National Gallery.
Nothing could surpass the beauty of the light and shade, and
the exquisite colouring. Study it as a type of the last word of
the humanist Renaissance against mediæval spirituality. Compare
it with the Memling close by: and, if you have been at
Milan, with the exquisitely dainty Luini in the Poldi-Pezzoli
Museum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above it, a Holy Family by <span class='it'>Murillo</span>. Spanish and theatrical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The greater part of this wall is taken up by an enormous
canvas (95), by <span class='it'>Paolo Veronese</span>, representing the Marriage at
Cana of Galilee, from the refectory (or dining-hall) of San
Giorgio Maggiore at Venice. Pictures of this subject, or of
the Last Supper, or of the Feast in the House of Levi, were
constantly placed as appropriate decorations to fill the end
wall of monastic refectories (like the famous Leonardo at
Milan), and were often therefore gigantic in size. This monstrous
and very effective composition (proudly pointed out by
the guides as “the largest oil-painting in the world”) contains
nothing of sacred, and merely reflects with admirable skill the
lordly character of the Italian Renaissance. In the centre of
the table, one barely notices the figures of the Christ and the
Madonna. Attention is distracted both from them and from
the miracle of the wine by the splendid architecture of the
background, the loggias, the accessories, and the gorgeous
guests, many of them representing contemporary sovereigns
(among them François I<sup>er</sup>, Eleanor of Austria, Charles V, and
Sultan Soliman). The group of musicians in the centre foreground
is also composed of portraits—this time of contemporary
painters (Titian, Tintoretto, etc.). As a whole, a most
characteristic picture both of the painter and his epoch, worth
some study, and full of good detail.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>**</span>39. <span class='it'>Giorgione.</span> Pastoral scene, with nude figures. One of
the few undoubted pictures by this master, whose genuineness
is admitted by Morelli, though much repainted. Should be
studied as an example of the full flush of the Venetian Renaissance,
and of the great master who so deeply affected it.
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>
Notice the admirable painting of the nude, and the fine landscape
in the background. Contrast with the Bellinis in the
Salle des Primitifs, in order to mark time and show the advance
in technique and spirit. Giorgione set a fashion, followed later
by Titian and others. Compare this work with Titian’s Jupiter
and Antiope in the Long Gallery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above it (<span class='bold'>*</span>427) <span class='it'>Rubens</span>. Adoration of the Magi. A splendid
picture. Interesting also as showing how far Rubens transformed
the conceptions of the earlier masters. Compare it with
the Luini in the Salle Duchâtel, and other Adorations in this
gallery. Full of gorgeousness, dash, and certainty of execution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>37. <span class='it'>Antonello da Messina.</span> Characteristic hard-faced portrait
by this excellent Sicilian artist.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>**</span>459. <span class='it'>Leonardo.</span> St. Anne and the Virgin. This great
artist can be better studied in the Louvre than anywhere else in
the world. This picture, not perhaps entirely by his own hand,
is noticeable for the beautiful and very Leonardesque face of
St. Anne, the playful figure of the infant Christ, and the admirable
blue-toned landscape in the background. The smiles are
also thoroughly Leonardesque. Notice the excellent drawing
of the feet. The curious composition—the Virgin sitting on
St. Anne’s lap—is traditional. Two or three examples of it
occur in the National Gallery. Leonardo transformed it. He
is the great scientific artist of the Florentine Renaissance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>208. <span class='it'>Hans Holbein</span>, the younger. Admirable portrait of
Erasmus. Full of character. Note carefully. The hands alone
are worth much study. How soft they are, and how absolutely
the hands of a scholar immersed in his reading and writing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>108. <span class='it'>Clouet.</span> Elizabeth of Austria. A fine example of the
early French school, marking well its hard manner and literal
accuracy. It shows the style in vogue in Paris before the
School of Fontainebleau (Italian artists introduced by François
I<sup>er</sup>) had brought in Renaissance methods.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>**</span>162. <span class='it'>Van Eyck.</span> Madonna and Child, with the Chancellor
Rollin in adoration. Perhaps Van Eyck’s masterpiece. Notice
the comparatively wooden Flemish Madonna and Child, contrasted
with the indubitable vitality and character in the face of
the Chancellor. This picture is a splendid example of the
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>
highest evolution of that type in which a votary is exhibited
adoring the Madonna—the primitive form of portrait: “paint
me in the corner, as giving the picture.” Every detail of this
finished work deserves long and close inspection. Notice the
elaboration of the ornaments, and the delicious glimpse of
landscape through the arcade in the background. Compare
with the Memlings; also, with contemporary Italian work in
the Salle des Primitifs.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>**</span>362. <span class='it'>Raphael.</span> Madonna and Child, with infant St. John,
known as <span class='it'>La Belle Jardinière</span>. To the familiar group of the
Madonna and Child, Florentine painters and sculptors early
added the infant Baptist, as patron of their city, thus forming a
graceful pyramidal composition. This exquisite picture, by far
the most beautiful Raphael in the Louvre, belongs to the great
painter’s Florentine period. It should be compared with the
very similar Madonna del Cardellino in the Uffizi at Florence.
For simplicity of treatment and beauty of colouring this seems
to me the loveliest of Raphael’s Madonnas, with the exception
of the Granduca. Look at it long, for colour, design, and
tender feeling. Then go back to the St. Michael, and see how,
as Raphael gains in dramatic vigour, he loses in charm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>407. <span class='it'>Rembrandt.</span> Christ and the Disciples at Emmaus. A
fine study in light and shade, and full of art, but not a sacred
picture. Compare with other pictures of the scene in this
gallery. The feeling is merely domestic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>433. <span class='it'>Rubens.</span> Tomyris, Queen of the Scythians, with the
head of Cyrus. A fine, vigorous painting, with the action
frankly transferred to the court of Henri IV. Dash and colour
and all the Rubens attributes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>365. <span class='it'>Raphael.</span> Small Holy Family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>364. <span class='it'>Raphael.</span> Holy Family, known as the “Sainte Famille
de François I<sup>er</sup>”: Joseph, Madonna, infant Christ, St. Elizabeth
and the Baptist, and adoring angels. Belongs to
Raphael’s Roman period, and already vaguely heralds the decadence.
Admirable in composition and painting, but lacking
the simplicity and delicacy of colour of his earlier work. Compare
it with the Belle Jardinière. It marks the distance
traversed in art during his lifetime. The knowledge is far
greater, the feeling less.
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>**</span>142. <span class='it'>Van Dyck.</span> Charles I. A famous and splendid portrait,
with all the courtly grace of this stately painter.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>**</span>462. <span class='it'>Leonardo.</span> Portrait of Mona Lisa. Most undoubted
work of the master in existence. Has lost much of its flesh
tints by darkening, but is still subtly beautiful. Compare with
any of the portraits in the Salle des Primitifs, in order to
understand the increase in science which made Leonardo the
prince and leader of the Renaissance. The sweet and sphinx-like
smile is particularly characteristic. Observe the exquisite
modelling of the hands, and the dainty landscape background.
Do not hurry away from it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>363. <span class='it'>Raphael.</span> Madonna with the infant St. John, known as
“La Vierge au Voile.” A work of his early Roman period,
intermediate in style between the Belle Jardinière and the
François I<sup>er</sup>. Compare them carefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above it (379) <span class='it'>Andrea del Sarto</span>. Charity. A fine example
of Andrea’s soft and tender colouring.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>*</span>523. Portrait of a young man. Long attributed to Raphael.
More probably <span class='it'>Franciabigio</span>. Pensive and dignified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>452. <span class='it'>Titian.</span> Alphonso of Ferrara and his Mistress. A fine
portrait, with its colour largely faded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above it, 154. Good portrait by <span class='it'>Van Dyck</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>539. <span class='it'>Murillo.</span> The Immaculate Conception. Luminous
and pretty, in an affected showy Spanish manner. Foreshadows
the modern religious art of the people. An immense
favourite with the inartistic public.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>**</span>121. <span class='it'>Gerard Dou.</span> The Dropsical Woman. A triumph
of Dutch painting of light and shade and detail. Faces like
miniatures. The lamp and curtain like nature. Illuminated
on the darkest day. Examine it attentively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>293. <span class='it'>Metsu.</span> Officer and Lady. Another masterpiece of
Dutch minuteness, but far less fine in execution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>526. <span class='it'>Ter Borch.</span> Similar subject treated with coarse directness.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>**</span>551. <span class='it'>Velasquez.</span> The Infanta Marguerite—a famous
portrait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little above it (229), <span class='it'>Sebastiano del Piombo</span>. Visitation.
Compare with the Ghirlandajo in the Salle des Primitifs. A
very favourable example of this Venetian master, painted in
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>
rivalry with Raphael. It well exhibits the height often
attained, even by minor masters, at the culminating point of
the Renaissance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above, occupying a large part of the wall, <span class='bold'>*</span><span class='it'>Paolo Veronese</span>.
Christ and the Magdalen, at the supper in the house of Levi.
Another refectory picture, treated in Veronese’s large and
brilliant manner, essentially as a scene of lordly Venetian life.
The Pharisee facing Christ is a fine figure. Notice the intrusion
of animals and casual spectators, habitual with this artist.
The sense of air and space is fine. The whole picture is
instinct with Venetian feeling of the period; scenic, not sacred.
A lordly treatment. Earlier painters set their scene in smaller
buildings: the Venetians of this gorgeous age chose rather
the Piazza of some mighty Renaissance Italian city. Here,
the architecture recalls the style of Sansovino.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This room also contains many good works of the 17th
century, justly skied. Examine them by contrast with the
paintings of the best ages of art beneath them. Return to them
later, after you have examined the works of the French artists
in later rooms of this Gallery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now proceed into the</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-variant:small-caps;'>Long Gallery</p>

<p class='noindent'>which contains in its <span class='bold'>First Compartment</span> works of the High
Renaissance masters, transitional from the conventionality of
the 15th, to the freedom of the 16th, and the theatrical tendency
of the 17th centuries. Begin on the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, and follow that wall as
far as the <span class='bold'>first archway</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Francia.</span> Crucifixion, with Madonna and St. John, and Job
extended at the feet of the cross, probably indicating a votive
plague offering. A tolerable example of the great Bolognese
painter, from the church of San Giobbe, patriarch and plague-saint,
at Bologna.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Ansuino</span>(?) Adoration of the Magi. Note coincidences with
others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>308. <span class='it'>Francia.</span> Madonna. A fair example.</p>

<p class='pindent'>168. <span class='it'>Dosso.</span> St. Jerome in the Desert. Interesting as
showing a later treatment of this familiar subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>230. <span class='it'>Luini.</span> Holy Family. A good specimen of Luini’s
easel work. Compare with the frescoes in the Salle Duchâtel.
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>
The hair is characteristic, also the oval face and cast of
features.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near it, two works by <span class='it'>Marco da Oggiono</span>, a pupil of Leonardo.
His work and Luini’s should be compared with that of the
founder of the school. The differences and agreements should
be observed. Notice also the survivals from earlier treatment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>354. <span class='it'>Sacchi.</span> The Four Doctors of the Church, attended by
the Symbols of the Four Evangelists. This is a composition
which frequently recurs in early art. L, St. Augustine, holding
his book “De Civitate Dei,” with the Eagle of St. John. Next,
St. Gregory, inspired by the Holy Spirit as a dove, and accompanied
by the Bull of St. Luke. Then, St. Jerome, in his
Cardinal’s hat, with the Angel of St. Matthew. Lastly, St.
Ambrose with his scourge (alluding to his action in closing the
doors of the church at Milan on the Emperor Theodosius after
the massacre of Thessalonica), accompanied by the winged
Lion of St. Mark. An interesting symbolical composition,
deserving close study.</p>

<p class='pindent'>232. <span class='it'>Luini.</span> The daughter of Herodias with the head of St.
John Baptist. A favourite subject with the artist, who often
repeated it. Compare it with his other works in this gallery,
till you feel you begin to understand Luini.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above it, <span class='it'>Borgognone</span>. Presentation in the Temple. In the
pallid colouring peculiar to this charming Lombard master.
Observe the positions of the High Priest and other personages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>85. <span class='it'>Borgognone.</span> St. Peter Martyr introducing or commending
a Lady Donor to the Madonna. One panel of a triptych;
the rest of it is wanting. Look out for similar figures of saints
introducing votaries. St. Peter Martyr has usually a wound or
a knife in his head, to indicate the mode of his martyrdom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beneath, a quaint little Leonardesque Annunciation.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Solario.</span> Calvary, characteristic of the School of Leonardo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beneath it, 394, <span class='bold'>*</span><span class='it'>Solario</span>. Madonna with the Green Cushion.
His masterpiece, a graceful and tender work, exhibiting the
growing taste of the Renaissance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>458. Attributed to <span class='it'>Leonardo</span>. The young St. John Baptist.
Hair, smile and treatment characteristic; but possibly a copy.
You will meet with many similar St. Johns in Florentine
sculpture below hereafter.
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>465. School of <span class='it'>Leonardo</span>. Holy Family. St. Michael the
Archangel oddly introduced in order to permit the Child Christ
to play with the scales in which he weighs souls—a curious
Renaissance conception, wholly out of keeping with earlier
reverential feeling.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>*</span>460. <span class='it'>Leonardo.</span> “La Vierge aux Rochers.” A replica of
the picture in the National Gallery in London. Much faded,
but probably genuine. Examine closely the rocks, the
Madonna, and the Angel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>395. <span class='it'>Solario.</span> Good portrait of Charles d’Amboise, a member
of the great French family who will frequently crop up in connection
with the Renaissance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>461. Attributed to <span class='it'>Leonardo</span>, more probably <span class='it'>Bernardino
de’ Conti</span>. Portrait of a Lady. Compare with the Mona Lisa,
as exhibiting well the real advance in portraiture made by
Leonardo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>463. Attributed to <span class='it'>Leonardo</span>, but probably spurious; Bacchus,
a fine youthful figure, begun as a St. John Baptist, and afterwards
altered. Compare with the other St. John Baptist near
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>*</span><span class='it'>Beltraffio.</span> The Madonna of the Casio family. A characteristic
Leonardesque virgin, attended by St. John Baptist and the
bleeding St. Sebastian. (A votive picture.) By her side kneel
two members of the Casio family, one the poet of that name,
crowned with laurel. Intermediate Renaissance treatment of
the Madonna and donors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>78 and 79. Good Franciscan saints, by <span class='it'>Moretto</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Between them, 298. Charming <span class='it'>Girolamo dai Libri</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We now come upon a magnificent series of works by <span class='bold'>Titian</span>,
in whom the Venetian School, ill-represented in its origin in
the Salle des Primitifs, finds its culminating point.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>**</span>440. <span class='it'>Titian.</span> The Madonna with the Rabbit. This is one
of a group of Titian’s Madonnas (several examples here) in
which he endeavours to transform Bellini’s type (see the specimen
in the Salle des Primitifs) into an ideal of the 16th century.
The Madonna is here attended by St. Catherine of Alexandria,
marked as a princess by her coronet and pearls. The child,
bursting from her arms, plays with the rabbit. Once more
a notion far-removed from primitive piety. Notice the background
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>
of Titian’s own country. <span class='bold'>Landscape</span> is now beginning
to struggle for recognition. Earlier art was all figures, first
sacred, then also mythological.</p>

<p class='pindent'>445. <span class='it'>Titian.</span> The Crown of Thorns. A powerful but very
painful painting. The artist is chiefly occupied with anatomy
and the presentation of writhing emotion. The spiritual is lost
in muscular action.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>**</span>443. <span class='it'>Titian.</span> The Disciples at Emmaus. Treated in the
contemporary Venetian manner. This is again a subject whose
variations can be well traced in this gallery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>451. <span class='it'>Titian.</span> Allegory of a husband who leaves for a campaign,
commending his wife to Love and Chastity. Finely
painted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>450. <span class='it'>Titian.</span> Portrait of François I<sup>er</sup>. Famous as having
been painted without a sitting—the artist had never even seen
the king. He took the face from a medal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>448. <span class='it'>Titian.</span> Council of Trent. Very much to order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above it, <span class='bold'>*</span><span class='it'>Titian</span>. Jupiter and Antiope. Charming Giorgionesque
treatment of the pastoral nude. Compare with the
Giorgione in the Salon Carré, in order to understand how
deeply that great painter influenced his contemporaries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>453. <span class='it'>Titian.</span> Fine portrait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>439. <span class='it'>Titian.</span> Madonna with St. Stephen, St. Ambrose, and
St. Maurice the soldier. Observe the divergence from the
older method of painting the accompanying saints. Originally
grouped on either side the Madonna, they are here transformed
into the natural group called in Italian, a “santa conversazione.”
Look at the stages of this process in the Salle des
Primitifs and this Long Gallery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>442. <span class='it'>Titian.</span> Another Holy Family. Interesting from the
free mode of its treatment, in contrast with Bellini and earlier
artists.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>**</span>455. <span class='it'>Titian.</span> Magnificent portrait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above these are several excellent Bassanos, worthy of study.
Compare together all these Venetian works (Bonifazio etc.),
lordly products of a great aristocratic mercantile community;
and with them, the Veroneses of the Salon Carré, where the
type attains a characteristic development.
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Now return to the door by the Salon Carré and examine
the <span class='bold'>R Wall</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor <span class='it'>Pinturicchio</span>, and two inferior <span class='it'>Peruginos</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>403. <span class='it'>Lo Spagna.</span> Nativity. Characteristic example of this
scholar of Perugino and fellow-pupil of Raphael. Notice its
Peruginesque treatment. Examine in detail and compare with
the two other painters. As a Nativity, it is full of the conventional
elements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>189. <span class='it'>Raffaellino del Garbo.</span> Coronation of the Virgin, beheld
from below by four attendant saints of, or connected with,
the Vallombrosan order—St. Benedict, Saint Salvi, San
Giovanni Gualberto, and San Bernardo degli Uberti. These
were the patrons of Vallombrosa; and the picture comes from
the Church of St. Salvi, at Florence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>246. <span class='it'>Manni.</span> Baptism in Jordan. Observe, as usual, the
attendant angels, though the simplicity of early treatment has
wholly disappeared. The head-dresses are characteristic of
the School of Perugino. Compare with Lo Spagna’s Nativity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above it (496) Florentine Madonna, with St. Augustine, St.
John Baptist, St. Antony and St. Francis. Observe their symbols.
I do not always now call attention to these; but the more
you observe them, the better you will understand each picture
as you come to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>390. <span class='it'>Luca Signorelli.</span> Adoration of the Magi. A fine example
of the mode of treatment of this excellent anatomical
painter, the forerunner of Michael Angelo. It needs long looking
into.</p>

<p class='pindent'>289. <span class='it'>Piero di Cosimo.</span> Coronation of the Virgin, with St.
Jerome, St. Francis, St. Louis of Toulouse and St. Bonaventura.
Compare with Raffaelino del Garbo, close by, for the double
scene, on earth and in heaven. Notice the crown which Louis
refused, in order to embrace the monastic profession. This is a
Franciscan picture; you will find it casts much light on assemblages
of saints if you know for what order each picture was
painted. The grouping <span class='it'>always</span> means <span class='it'>something</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>16. <span class='it'>Albertinelli.</span> Madonna on a pedestal, with St. Jerome
and St. Zenobius. Scenes from their legends in the background.
A characteristic example of the Florentine Renaissance. The
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>
grouping is in the style then fast becoming fashionable. Compare
with Lorenzo di Credi in the Salle des Primitifs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>144. <span class='it'>Pontormo.</span> Visitation. Showing the older Renaissance
tendencies. Compare with the Ghirlandajo, and note persistence
of the arch in the background.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>*</span>57. <span class='it'>Fra Bartolommeo.</span> Marriage of St. Catherine of Siena.
This is a variant on the legend of the other St. Catherine—of
Alexandria. The infant Christ is placing a ring on the holy
nun’s finger. Around are attendant saints—Peter, Vincent,
Stephen, etc. The composition is highly characteristic of the
painter and his school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>380. <span class='it'>Andrea del Sarto.</span> Holy Family. Exquisitely soft in
outline and colour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>372. Doubtful. Attributed to <span class='it'>Raphael</span>. Charming portrait
of a young man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond it,<span class='bold'>*</span> two most delicate little pictures of St. George (a
man) and St. Michael (an angel, winged) of <span class='it'>Raphael’s</span> very early
period. Note the princess in the St. George; you will come
upon her again. Simple and charming. Trace Raphael’s progress
in this gallery, by means of Kugler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond them, again, two portraits by <span class='it'>Raphael</span>, of which 373
is of doubtful authenticity.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>*</span>366. <span class='it'>Raphael.</span> The Young St. John: a noble figure.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>**</span>367. <span class='it'>Raphael.</span> St. Margaret: issuing triumphant from the
dragon which has swallowed her. A figure full of feeling and
movement, and instinct with his later science. It was painted
for François I<sup>er</sup>, out of compliment to his sister, Queen Margaret
of Navarre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All these Raphaels should be carefully studied. The great
painter began with a certain Peruginesque stiffness, through
which nevertheless his own native grace makes itself felt at
once; he progressed rapidly in knowledge and skill at Florence
and Rome, but showed a tendency in his last works towards the
incipient faults of the later Renaissance. By following him
here, in conjunction with Florence and Rome, you can gain an
idea of the course of his development.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Second Compartment</span> of the Long Gallery, which we
now enter, though containing several works by Titian and other
masters of the best period, is mainly devoted to painters of the
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>
later 16th and 17th century, when the decline in taste was rapid
and progressive. Notice throughout the substitution of rhetorical
gesture and affected composition for the simplicity of the
early masters, or the dignity and truth of the High Renaissance.
Begin again on the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> wall, containing finer pictures than that
opposite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>441. <span class='it'>Titian.</span> Another Holy Family, with St. Catherine.
Both women here are Venetian ladies of high rank and of his
own period. Observe, however, the persistence of the
Madonna’s white head-covering. Also, the playfulness introduced
in the treatment of St. Catherine’s palm of martyrdom,
and the childish St. John with his lamb. These attributes
would have been treated by earlier painters with reverence and
solemnity. Titian transfers them into mere pretty accessories.
Characteristic landscape background. (The female saint in
this work is usually described as St. Agnes, because of the
lamb: I think erroneously. The lamb is St. John’s, and the
St. Catherine merely plays with it.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>88. <span class='it'>Calcar.</span> Fine portrait of a young man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>38. Attributed (very doubtfully) to <span class='it'>Giorgione</span>. Holy Family,
with St. Sebastian, St. Catherine, and the donor, kneeling. A
good example of the intermediate treatment of saints in groups
of this character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above it (92) <span class='it'>Paolo Veronese</span>. Esther and Ahasuerus. Treated
in the lordly fashion of a Venetian pageant. Try now to understand
this Venetian ideal in style and colour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>91. <span class='it'>Paolo Veronese.</span> Similar treatment of Susanna and the
Elders, a traditional religious theme, here distorted into a mere
excuse for the nude, in which the Renaissance delighted.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>**</span>274. <span class='it'>Palma Vecchio.</span> Adoration of the Shepherds. A
noble example of this great Venetian painter. Observe how he
transforms the traditional accessories in the background, and
employs them in the thorough Venetian spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond it, several small Venetian pictures. Self-explanatory,
but worthy of close attention; especially 94, a delicate <span class='it'>Paolo
Veronese</span>, on a most unusual scale—a Venetian Dominican
nun presented by her patroness, St. Catherine, and St. Joseph
to the Madonna. Also, 93, by the same artist, St. George and
St. Catherine presenting a Venetian gentleman to the Madonna
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>
and Child. These two saints were the male and female patrons
of the Venetian territory; hence their frequency in Venetian
pictures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>99. The Disciples at Emmaus. Another characteristic
transformation by <span class='it'>Veronese</span> of a traditional scene. The pretence
of sacredness is very thin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>98. <span class='it'>Paolo Veronese.</span> Calvary. Similarly treated.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>*</span>335. <span class='it'>Tintoretto.</span> Susanna at the Bath. Admirable example
of this artist’s bold and effective method. In him the
Venetian School attains its last possible point before the decadence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beneath it, two good Venetian portraits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>336. <span class='it'>Tintoretto.</span> A characteristic Paradise (sketch for the
great picture in the Doge’s Palace at Venice), whose various
circles of saints and angels should be carefully studied.
Gloomy glory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above it, 17. A Venetian gentleman introduced to the Madonna
by St. Francis and a sainted bishop, with St. Sebastian
in the background. Doubtless, a votive picture in gratitude for
the noble donor’s escape from the plague.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond these, we come chiefly upon Venetian pictures of the
Decadence, among which the most noticeable are the Venetian
views by Canaletto and Guardi, showing familiar aspects of the
Salute, the Doge’s Palace, San Zaccaria, and other buildings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Further on, this compartment contains <span class='bold'>Spanish pictures</span>,—an
artificial arrangement not without some real justification,
since in the 16th and 17th centuries, Spain, enriched by her
American possessions, became, for a short period, the material
and artistic inheritor of Italy, and accepted in full the mature
fruits of the Italian Renaissance. At the same time, she imbued
the developed arts she received from Italy with Spanish
showiness and love of mere display, to the exclusion of deeper
spiritual feeling. The most famous among the few Spanish
pictures of the Louvre are:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>552. <span class='bold'>**</span><span class='it'>Velasquez.</span> Philip IV of Spain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beneath it, <span class='bold'>*</span><span class='it'>Murillo</span>. One of his favourite Boy Beggars,
killing fleas. A curious subject, excellently rendered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>548. <span class='it'>Ribera.</span> Adoration of the Shepherds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>540. <span class='it'>Murillo.</span> Birth of the Virgin, where the transformation
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>
of the traditional element is even more marked than in the
Italian Renaissance. The colouring splendid. St. Anne is
always seen in bed; other points you could notice in the
enamels at Cluny. With Murillo, they become mere excuses
for display of art-faculty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Further on, <span class='it'>Murillo</span>. The occupants of a poor monastery in
Spain miraculously fed by angels, known as “La Cuisine des
Anges.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not recommend more than a cursory examination of
these fine Spanish works, which can only be properly understood
by those who have visited Madrid and Seville. It will
suffice to note their general characteristics, and the way in
which they render traditional subjects. The best point of view
for the “Cuisine des Anges,” is obtained from the seat nearly
opposite, beneath the archway, when the splendid luminous
qualities of this theatrical picture can be better appreciated.
From this point also, many of the other Spanish pictures are
well seen with an opera-glass. They are not intended for close
examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(The <span class='bold'>columns</span> which separate these compartments have an
interesting history. They first belonged to a classical temple in
North Africa. They were brought thence by Louis XIV to
support a baldacchino at St. Germain-des-Prés. Finally, the
Revolution transferred them to the Louvre.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Return again, now, to the last archway, and begin once more
on the <span class='bold'>R side</span>, which contains for the most part tawdry works
of the Baroque period, which should, however, be studied to
some extent in illustration of the decadence of art in the later
16th century, and also as examples of further transformation
of the traditional motives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>53. <span class='it'>Barocci.</span> Madonna in Glory, with St. Antony and St.
Lucy. A good example of the insipid style which took its
name from this master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Below it, 309. <span class='it'>Bagnacavallo.</span> Circumcision, with twisted
pillars, showing the decline in architectural taste. The crowded
composition may be instructively compared with earlier and
simpler examples of this subject; also, with Fra Bartolommeo,
whose fine but complex arrangements rapidly resulted in such
confused grouping.
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>52. <span class='it'>Barocci.</span> Same scene. The tradition now entirely
ignored, and an unpleasantly realistic, yet theatrical and
mannered treatment, introduced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>304. After <span class='it'>Primaticcio</span>. Mythological concert, exhibiting
the taste of the <span class='bold'>School of Fontainebleau</span> (the Italian artists
of Raphael’s group, scholars of Giulio Romano, introduced into
France by François I<sup>er</sup>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>349. <span class='it'>Rosselli.</span> Triumphant David, with the head of Goliath.
Marking the advance of the histrionic tendency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A very cursory examination of the rest of the works on this
wall will probably be sufficient. Look them over in an hour.
The most celebrated are two by Salvator Rosa: 318, <span class='it'>Guido
Reni’s</span> Ecce Homo, full of tawdry false sentiment; and <span class='it'>Domenichino’s</span>
St. Cecilia (often copied), with the angel reduced to
the futile decorative winged boy of the period. 324, <span class='it'>Guido’s</span>
St. Sebastian, may be well compared with Perugino’s, as marking
the decline which art had suffered. It is on works like
these that the Spanish School largely based itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This completes the <span class='bold'>Italian collection</span> of the Louvre, to
which the visitor should return again and again, until he feels
he has entered somewhat into the spirit and tone of its various
ages.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Between the next two archways, we come to a small collection
of works of the <span class='bold'>Early French School</span>, too few of which
unfortunately remain to us.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Left Wall.</span> Two portraits of François I<sup>er</sup>, may be well compared
with the Titian of the same king, as indicating the gulf
which still separated France from the art-world of Italy. The
hard, dry, wooden manner of these French works is strongly
contrasted with the finished art of the Italian Renaissance.
Recollect that these seemingly archaic portraits are painted by
contemporaries of Raphael and Titian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Between them, good miniatures, by Nicolas Froment, of
King René and his Queen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above, 650. Admirable Dead Christ, with the Madonna,
Magdalen, Joseph of Arimathea, etc. In the best style of
the French School of the 15th century. Observe the action of
the various personages: all are conventional.
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond it, several good small pictures of the early French
Renaissance which should be carefully examined. Fouquet’s
portrait of Charles VII is a capital example of the older
method.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above them, 875, characteristic 15th century Crucifixion,
with Last Communion and Martyrdom of St. Denis. The
executioner’s face is French all over. (Scenes from the Passion
have often in French art such side-scenes from lives of
saints. Several at Cluny.) This picture has been employed
as a basis for the restoration of the reliefs in the portals at St.
Denis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond again, portraits of the early Renaissance, exhibiting
considerable advance in many cases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the <span class='bold'>R wall</span> are some works more distinctly characteristic
of the <span class='bold'>school of art</span> which grew up round Primaticcio and his
scholars at <span class='bold'>Fontainebleau</span>. Among them are a Diana hunting
(D. de Poitiers again), and a Continence of Scipio. They
reflect the style of Giulio Romano. Beneath the first, two
good portraits, with patron saints (John and Peter). All the
works in this compartment should be examined carefully, as
showing the raw material upon which subsequent French art
was developed.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond the next archway, we come to the pictures of the
<span class='bold'>Flemish School</span>, which deserve almost equal attention with
the Italian, as individual works, but which, as of less interest
in the general history of art, I shall treat more briefly. Begin
here on the <span class='bold'>R side</span>, for chronological order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the most noticeable pictures are Adam and Eve, unnumbered,
good specimens of the frank, unidealised northern
nude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>595. An exquisite early Annunciation, the spirit of which
should be compared with the early Italians. Notice the general
similarity of accessories, combined with the divergence in spirit,
the dwelling on detail, the Flemish love for effects of light and
shade on brass-work, fabrics, glasses, etc. Notice that this
charming picture gives us the early stage in the evolution of
that type of art which culminates in the Gerard Dou in the
Salon Carré.
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Beside it, an exquisitely tender Dead Christ. Remarkable
for the finish in the background.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Quentin Matsys</span> is not a worthy representative of the
master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beside it, a quaint and striking group of Votaries, listening to
a sermon. Probably a mere excuse for portrait-painting. The
character in the faces is essentially Flemish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fine portrait of a young man with a pink, in a red cap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Triptych, with the Madonna and Child (who may be well
compared with those of the Memling in the Salle Duchâtel).
On the flaps, the donor and his wife, introduced by their
patrons, St. John and St. Christopher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now cross over to the <span class='bold'>L side</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>*</span>698. <span class='it'>Rogier Van der Weyden.</span> Excellent Deposition, with a
touching St. John, and a very emaciated Dead Christ. These
scenes of death are extremely common in Flemish and German
art, and resulted in a great effort to express poignant emotion,
as contrasted with the calmer ecstatic character of Italian
art.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>**</span>279. <span class='it'>Quentin Matsys.</span> Banker and his wife. An admirable
and celebrated picture, with marvellous detail, of which
there are variants elsewhere. Notice the crystal vase, mirror,
leaves of book, and objects on shelves in background. The fur
is exquisitely painted.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>*</span>288 and 289. Two beautiful little <span class='it'>Memlings</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>588. Most characteristic and finished Holy Family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>699. <span class='it'>Memling.</span> St. Sebastian, Resurrection, Ascension.
Compare the first with Italian examples. Notice the extraordinarily
minute work in the armour and accessories, contrasted
with the blank and meaningless face of the Risen Saviour.
Flemish art, perfect in execution, seldom attains high ideals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>277 and 278. <span class='it'>Mabuse.</span> Virgin and donor. Excellent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>**596. <span class='it'>Gerard David.</span> Marriage at Cana. A splendid
specimen of this great and insufficiently recognised painter.
Background of buildings at Bruges. Every face and every
portion of the decorative work, including the jars in the foreground,
should be closely noticed. The kneeling donor is an
admirable portrait. As a whole, what a contrast to the Paolo
Veronese! The pretty, innocent face of the bride, with her air
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>
of mute wonder, is excellently rendered. I believe the donor in
this work is a younger portrait of the Canon who appears in the
glorious Gerard David in the National Gallery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Skied above all these pictures on either side are several
works by <span class='it'>Van Veen</span>, <span class='it'>Jan Matsys</span>, <span class='it'>Snyders</span> and others, mostly
worthy of notice. Among them, 136, <span class='it'>Van Dyck</span>, good Madonna
with the Magdalen and other saints.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We now come to the <span class='bold'>**</span>great series by <span class='bold'>Rubens</span> narrating
the <span class='bold'>History of Marie de Médicis</span>, in the inflated allegorical
style of the period. To understand them, the spectator should
first read an account of her life in any good French history.
These great decorative canvasses were painted hurriedly, with
even more than Rubens’s usual dash and freedom, to Marie’s
order, after her return from exile, for the decoration of her rooms
at the Luxembourg (see Part V) which she had just erected.
Though designed by Rubens, they were largely executed by
the hands of pupils; and while possessing all the master’s exuberant
artistic qualities in composition, they are not favourable
specimens of his art, as regards execution and technique. It
is to be regretted that most Englishmen and Frenchmen form
their impressions of the painter from these vigorous but rapid
pictures, rather than from his far nobler works at Antwerp,
Munich, and Vienna. I give briefly the meaning of the series.</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. The Three Fates spin Marie’s destiny. A small panel for
the side of a door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. Birth of Marie at Florence. Lucina, goddess of birth,
with her torch, attends the mother. Genii scatter flowers; others
hold her future crown. In the foreground, the River God of
the Arno, with his stream issuing from an urn, and accompanied
by the Florentine lion, as well as by boys holding the Florentine
lily. This curious mixture of allegorical personages and
realities is continued throughout the series.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. Her Education, presided over by Minerva, with the aid of
Mercury (to indicate her rapidity in learning), and Apollo, as
teacher of the arts. Close by are the Graces, admirable nude
figures. Among the accessories, bust of Socrates, painting
materials, etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>4. The Genius of France in attendance upon Henri IV,
while Love shows him Marie’s portrait. The attitude of the
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>
king expresses delight and astonishment. In the clouds,
Jupiter and Juno smile compliance. Below, little Loves steal
the king’s shield and helmet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>5. Marriage of Marie by proxy. The Grand Duke Ferdinand
represents the king. Hymen holds the torch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>6. Marie lands at Marseilles, and is received by France,
while Tritons and Nereids give easy passage to her vessel.
Above, her Fame. On the vessel, the balls or <span class='it'>palli</span> of the
Medici family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>7. Consummation of the Marriage at Lyons. The town itself
is seen in the background. In the foreground, the (personified)
city, crowned with a mural coronet, and designated by her lions.
Above, the King, as Jupiter, with his eagle, and the Queen, as
Juno, with her peacocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>8. Birth of her son, afterwards Louis XIII, at Fontainebleau.
Health receives the infant. Fortune attends the Queen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>9. The King, setting out to his war against Germany, makes
Marie Regent—allegorically represented by passing her the ball
of empire—and confides to her their son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larger pictures: No. 10, the Coronation of the Queen, and
No. 11, the Apotheosis of Henri, the painful scene of his death
being avoided. He is represented as raised to the sky by
Jupiter on one side, and Death with his sickle on the other.
Beneath, the assassin, as a serpent, wounded with an arrow.
Victory and Bellona mourning. Beyond, the allegorical figure
of France presenting the regency to Marie, with the acclamation
of the nobility and people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>12. The Queen’s government approved of by Jupiter, Juno,
and the heavenly powers. In the foreground Apollo, Mars,
and Minerva (the first copied from the antique statue known as
the Belvedere), representing courage, art, and literature, dispel
calumny and the powers of darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Continue on the <span class='bold'>opposite side</span>, crossing over <span class='bold'>directly</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>13. Civil discord arises. Marie starts for Anjou, attended
by Victory. Military preparations in the background.</p>

<p class='pindent'>14. The exchange of Princesses between allegorical figures
of France and Austria—each intended to marry the heir of the
other empire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>15. The Happiness of the Regency. The Queen bears the
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>
scales of justice. Plenty prevails. Literature, science, art, and
beauty predominate over evil, slander, and baseness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>16. Louis XIII attains his Majority (at 14) and mans the
ship of State in person, still attended by the counsels of his
mother. The Virtues row it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>17. Calumny overcomes the Queen. By the advice of her
counsellors, she takes refuge at Blois, escorted by Wisdom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>18. Mercury, as messenger, brings an olive branch to Marie,
as a token of reconciliation from her son, through the intermediation
of Richelieu and the Church party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>19. Marie enters the Temple of Peace, escorted by Mercury
and Truth with her torch, while blind Rage and the evil powers
stand baffled behind her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>20. Apotheosis of Marie and Louis: their reconciliation and
happiness. Final overthrow of the demons of discord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>21. Time brings Truth to light. Louis recognises the good
influence of his mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The history, as given in these pictures, is of course envisaged
from the point of view of a courtier, who desires to flatter and
please his patroness.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Beneath this great series of Rubens are a number of <span class='bold'>Dutch
and Flemish Pictures</span>, mostly admirable and well worthy of
attention, but, so to speak, self-explanatory. They belong entirely
to modern feeling. Dutch and Flemish art, in its later
form, is the domestic development of that intense love of minute
detail and accessories already conspicuous in Van Eyck,
Memling, and Gerard David. Sacred subjects almost disappear;
the wealthy burghers ask for portraits of themselves,
their wives and families, or landscapes for their households. I
would call special notice to the following among many which
should be closely examined to show the progress of art:—512,
<span class='it'>Teniers</span>; 691, <span class='it'>Rubens</span>; 518, <span class='it'>Teniers</span>; 238 and 239, <span class='it'>Van
Huysum</span>; <span class='bold'>*</span>425, a charming <span class='it'>Rubens</span>, in his smaller and more
delicate style; 147, admirable portrait by <span class='it'>Van Dyck</span>; 513, an
excellent <span class='it'>Teniers</span>; <span class='bold'>*</span>461, a good portrait by <span class='it'>Rubens</span>; 125, exquisite,
luminous <span class='it'>Gerard Dou</span>; next it <span class='bold'>**</span><span class='it'>Van der Helst’s</span> Four
Judges of the Guild of Cross-bow-men deciding on the prizes,
one of the most perfect specimens of this great portrait painter.
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>
Notice the wonderful life-like expressions. Then 123, another
exquisite luminous <span class='it'>Dou</span>; 542, <span class='it'>Van de Velde</span>; 41, splendid
portrait by <span class='it'>Bol</span>; 130, <span class='it'>Gerard Dou</span> by himself; <span class='bold'>**</span>404, <span class='bold'>Rembrandt</span>,
Raphael leaving the house of Tobias, a master-piece of
the artist’s weird and murky luminosity—strangely contrasted
with Italian examples; 205, a good <span class='it'>Hobbema</span>; 133, fine portrait
by <span class='it'>Duchâtel</span>; 369, excellent family group by <span class='it'>Van Ostade</span>; next
it, 126, a delicious little <span class='it'>Dou</span>. But, indeed, every one of these
Dutch paintings should be examined separately, in order to
understand the characteristic Dutch virtues of delicate handling,
exquisite detail, and domestic portraiture. They are the artistic
outcome of a nation of housewives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the <span class='bold'>opposite side</span> the series is continued with admirable
flower-pieces, landscapes by Van der Veldt and Karel du
Jardin, and several noteworthy portraits, among which notice
the famous <span class='bold'>*</span><span class='it'>Van Dyck</span> (143) of the children of Charles I., most
daintily treated. Beyond the Rubenses, again, on this side,
144, two noble portraits by <span class='it'>Van Dyck</span>, and several excellent
examples of Philippe de Champaigne, a Flemish artist who
deeply influenced painting in France, where he settled. <span class='bold'>**</span>151,
<span class='it'>Van Dyck’s</span> Duke of Richmond, perhaps his most splendid
achievement in portraiture, deserves careful study. I do not
further enlarge upon these subjects because the names and
dates of the painters, with the descriptions given on the frames,
will sufficiently enable the judicious spectator to form his own
conceptions. Devote at least a day to Dutch and Flemish art
here, and then go back to the Salon Carré, to see how the
Rembrandts, Dous, and Metsus, there unfortunately separated
from their compeers, fall into the general scheme of Dutch
development.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Good view out of either window as you pass the next archway.
Look out for these views in all parts of the Louvre. They
often give you glimpses of the minor courtyards, to which the
general public are not admitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>next two compartments</span> contain further Dutch and
Flemish pictures of high merit—portraits, still-life, landscape,
and other subjects. The scenes of village life are highly
characteristic. Notice in this connection the growing taste
for <span class='bold'>landscape</span>, at first with a pretence of figures and animals,
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>
but gradually asserting its right to be heard on its own account.
In Italy, under somewhat similar commercial conditions, we
saw this taste arise in the Venetian School, with Cima, Giorgione,
and Titian; in Holland, after the Reformation put sacred
art at a discount, it became almost supreme. And note at the
same time how the Reformation in commercial countries has
wholly altered the <span class='bold'>type</span> of northern art, focussing it on trivial
domestic incidents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the many beautiful pictures in these compartments
the spectator should at least not miss, on the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, the very
charming <span class='bold'>**</span>Portrait by <span class='it'>Rubens</span> (not quite finished) of his
second wife and two children, scarcely inferior to the lovely
specimen at Munich. Near it, an admirable Crucifixion
with the Madonna, St. John, and Magdalen, more reminiscent
than is usual with Rubens of earlier compositions. On
the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> side, notice a portrait of Elizabeth of France (459), by
<span class='it'>Rubens</span>, in his other, stiffer, and more courtly manner. We
may well put down this peculiarity to the wishes of the sitter.
His <span class='bold'>*</span>Kermesse, near it, is an essay in the style afterwards
popularized by Teniers, in which the great artist permits his
Flemish blood to overcome him, and produces a clever but most
unpleasant picture. The numerous admirable fruit and flower
pieces, works in still-life, etc., which these compartments contain,
must be studied for himself by the attentive visitor. In Rubens’
great canvas of the Triumph of Religion, painted for a Spanish
commission, observe his curious external imitation of Spanish
tendencies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After having completed his examination of the Long Gallery,
the visitor may next proceed to the five small rooms—<span style='font-size:smaller'>IX</span>, <span style='font-size:smaller'>X</span>, <span style='font-size:smaller'>XI</span>,
<span style='font-size:smaller'>XII</span>, and <span style='font-size:smaller'>XIII</span> on Baedeker’s map—devoted to</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-variant:small-caps;'>The German, English and Early French Schools.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the <span class='bold'>early German works</span> in the 2nd of these rooms,
the visitor may particularly notice (<span class='bold'>*</span>22), <span class='it'>Hans Holbein’s</span> portrait
of Southwell, full of character. Above it, a quaint Venus by
<span class='it'>Cranach</span>, instinct with the northern conception of the crude nude.
Next, two good portraits by <span class='it'>Holbein</span>. In the centre of this wall,
<span class='bold'>*</span>a Descent from the Cross, of the School of Cologne, which
should be compared with similar pictures of the Italian and
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>
Flemish Schools. The somewhat exaggerated expression of grief
on all the faces is strongly characteristic of German tendencies.
The figure of the Magdalen, to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, strikes the German keynote;
so does Joseph of Arimathea receiving the Crown of Thorns.
Study this well, for coincidences with and differences from Italian
treatment. Beyond it, two fine <span class='it'>Holbeins</span>, of the astronomer
Kratzer, and <span class='bold'>*</span>Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury, the latter a
marvellous piece of painting. The opposite wall also contains
good portraits and sacred pieces, among which an altar-piece by
the “Master of the Death of the Virgin,” deserves careful study.
(Most early German masters are unknown to us by name, and
are thus identified by their most famous pictures.) The Last
Supper in this work, below, is largely borrowed from Leonardo.
Compare with the copy of Leonardo’s fresco at Milan in the
Long Gallery, probably by Marco da Oggionno, which hangs
near the Vierge aux Rochers. The Adoration of the Magi (597),
should also be compared with the Italian examples; notice in
particular the burgher character of the Three Kings, which is
essentially German. The other works in this room can be
sufficiently studied (for casual observers) by the aid of the
labels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>English Room</span> contains a few examples of English
masters of the last and present century, none of them first-rate.
The most famous is the frequently reproduced Little Girl with
Cherries by the pastellist <span class='it'>John Russel</span>. It is a pleasing work,
but not good in colour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next room, with an admirable view from the window,
begins the <span class='bold'>Modern French School</span> (in the wide sense), and
contains Le Sueur’s History of the Life of St. Bruno, painted
for a Carthusian monastery near the Luxembourg—of which
order the saint was the founder. They are characteristic examples
of the French work of the early 17th century, and they
exhibit the beginnings of the national tendencies in art. The
legends are partially explained on the frames, and more fully
in Mrs. Jameson’s “Monastic Orders.” On a cursory inspection,
the observer will notice the marked French tendency in
the 9th, 7th, 21st, and 22nd of the series. Cold and lifeless in
design and colour, these feeble works have now little more
than a historical interest.
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Before proceeding to the succeeding rooms of the</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-variant:small-caps;'>French School,</p>

<p class='noindent'>you had better form some conception of the circumstances
and conditions under which that school arose. The artists
whom François I<sup>er</sup> invited to Fontainebleau had little influence
on French art, except in sculpture (where we shall see
their spirit abundantly at work when we come to examine the
Renaissance sculpture in this collection). Primaticcio and his
followers, however, left behind them in France, as regards
painting, scarcely more than the sense of a need for improvement.
Succeeding French artists took up the Italian Renaissance
in the stage represented by the later decadents and the
eclectic Caracci. Nicolas Poussin (1594–1665) is the first
Frenchman to attain distinction in this line; he throws something
of French sentimentality into the affected mythological
scenes of contemporary Italy. Claude of Lorraine, again, is
almost an Italian by training and style; his artificial landscapes,
not copied direct from nature, but built up by arbitrary and often
impossible conjunctions, represent the prevailing tendencies of
Italian art in the 17th century. On the other hand, the influence
of Rubens, many of whose greatest works were painted
for French kings, or came early to France, and still more of
Philippe de Champaigne, a Brussels master who settled in Paris
and painted much for Richelieu and Marie de Médicis, introduced
into France a strain of Flemish influence. On these two
schools—decadent Italian and later Flemish—then, modern
French art at first based itself; the final outcome is a resultant
of the two, transmuted and moulded in spirit and form by the
innate, though at first unrealised, French tendencies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Also, before you proceed to examine the subsequent specimens
of the development of French art, you had better return
to the Salon Carré to inspect the portraits by Philippe de
Champaigne, as well as the Jouvenet, the Rigaud, and other
French works there, which I purposely passed by on our
previous visit, as out of harmony with the Italian masterpieces.
On your way back, glance at the later Italian pictures in the
First Compartment of the Long Gallery (particularly at Bronzino’s
odiously vulgar Christ and Mary Magdalen, and Rossi’s
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>
Doubting Thomas, both skied, on your <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>) as conspicuous
examples of the sort of thing admired at the time when the
French School took its first flights and made its earliest
experiences. Then observe once more the works of the
School of Fontainebleau; and, finally, inspect the pictures in
Baedeker’s Room IX; after which, you will be in a position
to start fair in Room XIII, with the French School in the 17th
century.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This Small Room beyond the St. Brunos contains more
favourable specimens of <span class='it'>Le Sueur’s</span> faculty (such as 559, 556,
and 551), in which a distinctive French tendency still more
markedly announces itself. The Ganymede, in 563, in particular,
faintly foreshadows at a distance the classic painters of
the Empire. We see in this room, in a very vague way, an
early stage in the evolution of a David.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Passing through the Landing, at the head of the staircase
(with interesting terra-cotta Etruscan sarcophagi) we arrive at
the Great Gallery of <span class='bold'>French paintings of the 17th century</span>.
These may be examined somewhat in the mass, exhibiting, as
they do, rather the courtly tendencies of the age of Louis XIV
than any great individual artistic faculty. We must understand
them in the spirit which built Versailles and conducted the
wars on the north-eastern frontier. They are painted for the
most part by the command of His Majesty. Only here and
there does a faintly individual work, like <span class='it'>Le Sueur’s</span> Christ and
the Magdalen, and Bearing of the Cross, or <span class='it'>Lebrun’s</span> Crucifixion,
arrest for a moment one’s passing attention. The crudeness of
the colour, and the insufficiency of the composition, will be the
chief points, in a general survey, to strike the spectator. (On
a screen in the centre, out of proper place among its contemporaries,
hangs at present <span class='it'>Paul Delaroche’s</span> famous Christian
Martyr.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The student who has courage to attack this mass of uninteresting
art in detail, should observe particularly the works of
<span class='it'>N. Poussin</span>, as forming the point of departure for the School in
general. His Bacchanal and other mythological works set the
fashion of those dreary allegorical scenes which cover so many
yards of ceilings in the Louvre. Observe the mixture of
religious themes, like <span class='it'>Lebrun’s</span> Martyrdom of Stephen, and
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>
<span class='it'>N. Poussin’s</span> Holy Family, with classical pictures like the
Rescue of Pyrrhus, and the Alexander and Porus, as well as the
close similarity of treatment in both cases. Among the best of
the lot are <span class='it'>Jouvenet’s</span> Raising of Lazarus, and <span class='it'>Lesueur’s</span> Paul
Preaching at Ephesus (partly after Raphael). <span class='bold'>*<span class='it'>Poussin’s</span></span> “Et
in Arcadia ego,” a rustic morality, is also famous, and is
regarded as the greatest achievement of this artificial School.
<span class='it'>Claude’s</span> landscapes, often with a small inserted mythological
story by another painter, deserve attention. (Note that landscape
has hardly yet vindicated its claim to independent existence.)
On the whole, it may be said that this room represents
the two prevailing influences in French art of the purely monarchical
period of Louis XIV,—either the pictures are quasi-royal
and official, or else they are religious, for church or
monastery. The mythological scenes, indeed, have often a
royal reference—are supposed parallels of contemporary events;
and even the religious scenes, wholly destitute of spiritual feeling,
are painted in a courtly, grandiose manner. They are
saints as conceived by flunkeys. Not till the Revolution swept
away the royal patron did the French spirit truly realise itself.
This room <span class='bold'>reveals the Court</span>, not the nation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next room, in the Pavillon Denon, a connecting passage,
contains <span class='bold'>Portraits of Painters</span>, chiefly by themselves,
a few of which are worthy of attention. Among them is the
famous and touching <span class='bold'>**</span>portrait by <span class='bold'>Mme. Lebrun</span> of herself
and her daughter, which, in spite of some theatrical sentiment
here and there obtruded, is a charming realisation of maternal
feeling amply reciprocated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond it we come to the <span class='bold'>French Gallery of the 18th
century</span>, reflecting for the most part the spirit of the Regency
and the Louis XV period. Much of it is meretricious; much
of it breathes the atmosphere of the boudoir. The flavour of
Du Barry pervades it almost all. It scents of musk and
powder. The reader will pick out for himself such works as
he admires in this curious yet not wholly unpleasing mass of
affectation and mediocrity. Indeed, as opposed to the purely
official work in the preceding French room, the growth of the
<span class='bold'>rococo</span> spirit, to be traced in this gallery, is by no means without
interest. The one set of works sets forth the ideal of
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>
monarchy as a formal institution; the other displays its actual
outcome in royal mistresses and frivolous amusements. Here
too the ornate French taste—the Dresden china and Sèvres
taste—finds its first faint embodiment. <span class='it'>Greuze’s</span> famous
<span class='bold'>*</span>Cruche Cassée (263), is the chief favourite with visitors to this
room. It has about it a certain false simplicity, a pretended
virginal innocence, which is perhaps the highest point of art
this school could attain. <span class='it'>Drouais’s</span> child portraits (187), are
more entirely characteristic, in their red-and-white chubbiness,
of the ideas of the epoch. The pastoral scenes by <span class='it'>Watteau</span>
and <span class='it'>Vanloo</span>, represent nature and country life, as they envisaged
themselves to the painted and powdered great ladies
of the Trianon. <span class='it'>Coypel’s</span> Esther before Ahasuerus is a not
unfavourable specimen of the inflated quasi-sacred style of the
period. Some good portraits redeem the general high level of
mediocrity in this room, but do not equal those of the daintily
aristocratic English School of the end of the 18th century.
Two <span class='it'>Greuzes</span> (267 and, still more, 266), reveal the essentially
artificial methods of this superficially taking painter. Most
observers begin by admiring him and end by disliking his
ceaseless posing. <span class='it'>Boucher’s</span> artificial pink-and-white nudities
(as in 24 and 26), have the air of a man who painted, as he did,
in a room hung round with rose-coloured satin. He is perhaps
the most typical of these rococo artists: he imitates on canvas
the coquettish ideals of the contemporary china-painters. <span class='it'>Fragonard</span>,
again, throws into this school the love of display and
bravado of a southern temperament. At the far end of the
room we find in <span class='it'>Greuze’s</span> later moralising pictures faint indications
of the altered and somewhat more earnest feeling which
produced the revolutionary epoch, still closely mixed up with
the ineradicable affectation and unreality of the painter and his
period. Two little stories of a Prodigal Son and his too late
return, on either side of the doorway, with their violent theatrical
passion and their excessive expression of impossible emotion,
illustrate well this nascent tendency. They are attempts
to feel where feeling was not really present. <span class='it'>David’s</span> Paris
and Helen introduces us, on the other hand, to the beginnings
of the cold classicism which prevailed under the Empire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In order to continue the chronological examination of the
<span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>
French School the visitor must now return to the Salon Carré
and traverse the vulgarly ornate Galerie d’Apollon by its side
(which contains objects of more or less artistic interest in the
precious metals and precious stones, many of which, especially
those in the two last cases, deserve careful inspection. A
morning should, if possible, be devoted later to this collection).</p>

<p class='pindent'>A short connecting room beyond (with gold Etruscan jewelery)
gives access next to the <span class='bold'>Salle des Sept Cheminées</span>, which
contains many stiff but excellent works of the period of the
<span class='bold'>Empire</span>. The most noticeable of these are by <span class='it'>David</span>, whose
formal classicism (a result of the revolutionary revolt from
Christianity, with its reliance upon Greek, and still more Roman,
morality and history) is excellently exemplified in his large
picture of the <span class='bold'>*</span>Sabine Women Intervening between their
Husbands and their Fathers. This is considered his masterpiece.
Its frigid style, not very distantly resembling that of
a bas-relief, and its declamatory feeling do not blind us to the
excellence of its general technique and its real advance on the
art of the 18th century. <span class='it'>David</span> imitated the antique, but
was always sculpturesque rather than pictorial in treatment.
Among other fine examples of this <span class='bold'>classic period</span>—the transitional
stage between the 18th century and the distinctively
modern spirit—attention may be called to <span class='it'>Gérard’s</span> Cupid
and Psyché, and to his fine portrait of the Marquis Visconti.
<span class='bold'>*<span class='it'>Mme. Lebrun’s</span></span> charmingly animated portrait of Mme. Molé-Raymond,
the comedian, is full of real vigour. Two good
portraits by <span class='it'>David</span>, of himself and Pius VII, deserve close
inspection. <span class='it'>Gros’s</span> Bonaparte at Arcola, is also interesting.
<span class='bold'><span class='it'>Mme. Lebrun’s</span></span> earlier portrait of herself and her daughter
is less beautiful than the one we have already examined.
Several military portraits, such as Gros’s Fournier-Sarlovèze,
reflect the predominant militarism of the epoch. <span class='it'>David’s</span>
huge canvas of the Coronation of Napoleon I in Notre-Dame
is typical of another side of the great artist’s development.
Gradually, the frigidity of the early revolutionary period gave
way to the growing <span class='bold'>romanticism</span> of 1830. <span class='it'>Géricault’s</span> Raft of
the Medusa (sighting a sail after twelve days out), strikes
the first keynote of the modern romantic movement. It
created a great sensation in its own day, and gave rise to
<span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>
endless discussion and animadversion. It marks the advent
of the <span class='bold'>emotional</span> in modern art. <span class='it'>Gros’s</span> Bonaparte Visiting
the Plague-stricken at Jaffa, also indicates in another way a
marked modernising tendency. The school of blood and
wounds, of the morbid and the ghastly, has here its forerunner.
All the works in this room (which modernity forbids me to treat
at adequate length) should be carefully studied in detail and
comparison by those who wish to understand the various steps
which led to the evolution of modern French painting. <span class='it'>Guérin’s</span>
Return of Marcus Sextus, and <span class='it'>Girodet’s</span> Burial of Atala,
in particular, mark special phases of transition from the coldly
classical to the romantic tendency. This room, in one word,
begins with the <span class='bold'>severe</span>; it ends with the <span class='bold'>melodramatic</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room beyond, known as the <span class='bold'>Salle Henri II</span>, is so nearly
modern in tone that the reader may be safely trusted to inspect
it on his own knowledge. <span class='it'>Giraud’s</span> Slave-dealer and <span class='it'>Chassériau’s</span>
Tepidarium are its most popular pictures. It lies outside the
scope of the present handbook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Salle La Caze</span>, however, still beyond, contains a collection
kept separately apart by the express desire of the donor,
and includes many works both of earlier schools and of the
French 17th and 18th century, worthy of the greatest attention.
It is especially rich in works of the <span class='bold'>rococo</span> painters, better exemplified
here than in the main collection. Beginning on the
<span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, I will merely enumerate a few of the most important works.
An excellent <span class='it'>Hondekoeter</span>, skied. A noble portrait by <span class='it'>Tintoretto</span>
of a Venetian magnate. A most characteristic <span class='it'>Fragonard</span>,
full of the morganatic sentiment of the 18th century. Portraits
by <span class='it'>Nattier</span>, affording more pleasing examples of the early 18th
century style than those we have hitherto examined. Above it,
a mediocre <span class='it'>Tintoretto</span> of Susanna at the Bath, not good in
colour. Centre of the hall, <span class='bold'>*</span><span class='it'>Watteau’s</span> Gilles, an excellent
embodiment of the innocent fool of traditional French comedy.
<span class='bold'>*</span><span class='it'>Frans Hals’s</span> sly figure of a Gipsy Woman is a fine piece of
vulgar character-painting. A good <span class='it'>Greuze</span>, etc. Examine more
particularly the works by <span class='it'>Watteau</span>, <span class='it'>Fragonard</span>, and other
boudoir painters, whose pictures on this wall give a more
pleasing and fuller idea of the temperament of their school than
that which we obtained in other parts of the collection. R wall
<span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>
returning—several good <span class='it'>Watteaus</span>, <span class='it'>Bouchers</span>, <span class='it'>Greuzes</span>, etc.
Excellent small Dutch pictures. Fine portrait by <span class='it'>Rembrandt</span>.
Rembrandt’s Woman at the Bath is a characteristic example
of his strikingly original conception of the nude. <span class='it'>Ribera’s</span> Club-footed
Boy is a Spanish pendant to Frans Hals’s Gipsy. This
room, containing as it does very mixed examples of all the
schools, should only be visited after the spectator has obtained
some idea of each in other parts of the collection. Its Dutch
works, in particular, are admirable. I do not enumerate them,
as enumeration is useless, but leave it to the reader to pick out
for himself several fine examples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now traverse the Galerie d’Apollon, Salon Carré, and Long
Gallery till you arrive at the</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-variant:small-caps;'>Hall of Painters of the 19th Century,</p>

<p class='noindent'>(Room VIII in Baedeker’s plan). This hall contains for the
most part the works of artists of the period of Louis Philippe and
the early Second Empire—almost our own contemporaries. I
will therefore only briefly call attention here to the pictures of
the <span class='bold'>romantic historical school</span>, then so prevalent in France,
of which <span class='it'>Delaroche’s</span> Death of Queen Elizabeth and Princes in
the Tower and <span class='it'>Delacroix’s</span> Capture of Constantinople by the
Crusaders are conspicuous examples. <span class='it'>Devéria’s</span> popular Birth
of Henri IV belongs to the same category. These “picturesque”
treatments of history answer in painting to the
malign influence of Walter Scott and Victor Hugo in literature.
Contrasted with them are such semi-classical works of
the school of David, softened and modernised, as <span class='it'>Ingres’s</span> Apotheosis
of Homer—the great poet crowned by Fame, with the
Iliad and Odyssey at the base of his pedestal, and surrounded
by a concourse of ancient and modern singers. It is cold but
dignified. <span class='it'>Lethière’s</span> Death of Virginia, and <span class='it'>Couture’s</span> Romans
of the Decadence, represent to a certain extent a blending of
these two main influences. I will not, however, particularise,
as almost every picture in this room deserves some study from
the point of view of the evolution of contemporary art. I will
merely ask the reader not to overlook <span class='it'>Flandrin’s</span> famous nude
figure, the typical landscapes by <span class='it'>Rousseau</span> and <span class='it'>Millet</span>, and
<span class='it'>David’s</span> exquisite portrait of Mme. Récamier—sufficient in itself
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>
to immortalise both artist and sitter. The electric influence
of a beautiful and pure-souled woman has here galvanised
David for once into full perception and reproduction of truth
and nature. Even the severe Empire furniture and background
exactly accord with the character of the picture. Ary Scheffer’s
religious works, in his peculiar twilight style, on a solid blue
background, will strike every observer. <span class='it'>Millet’s</span> Gleaners and
<span class='it'>Troyon’s</span> group of oxen strike each a new note in art at the
period when they were painted. As a whole this Gallery represents
all the various strands of feeling which have gone to
the production of modern painting. It attains to the threshold
of cosmopolitanism in its Arabs, its negroes, and its Algerian
women: it is bloodthirsty and sensuous; it is calm and meditative;
it dashes with Courbet; it refines with Millet; it oscillates
between the world, the flesh, and the devil; it is pious
and meretricious; it sums up in itself the endless contradictory
and interlacing tendencies of the Nineteenth Century. As regards
chronological sequence, one may say pretty fairly that it
begins with classicism, passes through romanticism, and ends
for the moment in religious reaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Come back often to the pictures in the Louvre, especially the
Salle des Primitifs, the Salon Carré, and the first two bays of
the Long Gallery.</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-variant:small-caps;'>Further Hints on the Paintings in the Louvre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reader must not suppose that these brief notes give anything
like an adequate idea of the way in which pictures in such
a gallery as the Louvre ought to be studied. My object in these
Guides being mainly to open a door, that the tourist himself
may enter and look about him carefully, I have given first this
connected account of <span class='it'>all</span> the rooms in chronological order, for
the use of those whose time is very limited, and who desire to
go through the collection seriatim. But for the benefit of others
who can afford to pay <span class='bold'>many successive visits</span>, I will now take
one or two particular pictures <span class='bold'>in detail</span>, suggesting what seem
to me the best and most fruitful ways in which to study them.
Try for yourself afterwards to fill in a similar scheme, as far as
you can, for most of the finest works in this Gallery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I will begin with No. 251, in the Salle des Primitifs—Mantegna’s
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>
beautiful and glowing <span class='bold'>Madonna della Vittoria</span>. And
I take Mantegna first, because (among other reasons) he is a
painter who can be fairly well studied by means of the pictures
in this Gallery alone, without any large reference to his remaining
works in Italy or elsewhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, first, who and what was <span class='bold'>Mantegna</span>, and what place
does he fill in the <span class='bold'>history of art</span> in Italy? Well, he was a
<span class='bold'>Paduan</span> painter, born in 1431, died in 1506—about the time
when Raphael was painting the Belle Jardinière, in this collection.
He was a contemporary and brother-in-law of Giovanni
and Gentile Bellini: and if you compare his work with that of
the two Bellinis, even as very inadequately represented here,
you will see that their art has much in common—that they
stood at about the same level of historical evolution, and painted
in the same careful, precise, and accurate manner of the second
half of the fifteenth century. Contrast them, on the one hand,
with their immediate predecessors, such as Filippo Lippi and
Benozzo Gozzoli (juniors by roughly about 20 years), in order
to mark the advance they made on the art of those who
went just before them; and compare them, on the other hand,
with their immediate successors, such as Raphael, and even
their more advanced contemporaries, like Leonardo, in order to
see what place they fill in the development of painting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again, Mantegna was a pupil of <span class='bold'>Squarcione of Padua</span>,
who practically founded the Paduan school. Now Squarcione
had travelled in Greece and formed a collection of antiques,
from which his pupils made drawings and studies. Also
<span class='bold'>Donatello</span> (the great Florentine sculptor of the early Renaissance,
of whose work you can find some beautiful examples in
the Renaissance Sculpture rooms of this museum) had executed
several bronzes in the church of Sant’ Antonio, the great local
saint of Padua; and these likewise Mantegna studied; so that
much of his work bears traces of the influence of sculpture and
especially of bas-relief. He is particularly fond of introducing
reliefs, festoons of fruit or flowers, and classical detail into the
accessories of his pictures: and these peculiarities are well
marked in the Mars and Venus, the Crucifixion, and the Madonna
della Vittoria in this collection. Compare all these
closely with one another till you think you have formed a fair
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>
idea of Mantegna’s powerful drawing, strong realism, love of
the antique, solemnity and dignity, clear-cut style, and perfect
mastery of anatomy and technique. Notice his delicate, careful,
conscientious workmanship; the precision and perfection of his
hands and feet; the joy with which he lingers over classical
costume and the painting of armour. Everything is sharp and
defined as in the air of Italy, yet never hard, or crude, or
angular. Observe, also, the sculpture-like folds of his carefully
arranged draperies, and his love for shot colours and melting
tints on metal or marble. The St. Michael in this picture, and
the Roman soldiers in the Crucifixion, are admirable examples
of this tone in his colouring. If you wished to characterise
Mantegna in a single phrase, however, you might fairly say he
was the most <span class='bold'>sculpturesque</span> of painters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to date, the <span class='bold'>Crucifixion</span> (in the Salon Carré) which
formed one piece only of the <span class='bold'>predella</span>, or series of small
pictures at the base of the great Madonna in the Church of
San Zeno at Verona, is the earliest example of Mantegna’s work
here. It displays the delicate and exquisite finish of his youthful
period: but it is much more mediæval in tone—has far less
freedom and conscious artistic power—than the Madonna della
Vittoria, which belongs to the latest epoch of the great painter’s
development. Observe the early severity of the figures in the
Crucifixion, and the firmness of the drawing: each personage
stands out with statuesque distinctness. But note, too, that at
this early stage, Mantegna’s expression of emotion was still
inadequate: in his striving to be powerful, he overdid the
passions, sometimes almost to the verge of grotesqueness. On
the other hand, do not overlook the dramatic force of the
picture, as shewn, for example, in the vivid contrast between
the anguish of the Madonna, with her attendant St. John, &amp;c.,
and the callous carelessness of the soldiers casting lots for the
Redeemer’s raiment. The Mars and Venus, once more, of his
middle period, represents an intermediate stage between the
two styles. What is meant by a <span class='bold'>predella</span>, again, you can see
by looking at Fra Angelico’s Coronation of the Virgin, and other
similar pictures in this room—the little figures of St. Dominic
and his miracles beneath the main altar-piece being examples
of this adjunct. The Crucifixion formed the central picture of
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>
three such minor episodes: the Agony in the Garden and the
Ascension, to right and left of it, are now in the Museum
at Tours. Napoleon I had carried off the entire work from
Verona: at the Restoration, the Madonna was returned to San
Zeno, but the three pieces of the predella were retained in
France and thus distributed. If you go to Tours or Verona,
recollect the connection of the various fragments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next, what was the <span class='bold'>occasion</span> for painting this Madonna della
Vittoria? You will remember that in 1494, Charles VIII of
France, invited by Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, invaded
North Italy, and conquered a large part of it, including Florence,
Pisa, and Rome itself. Marching then on Naples, the boy king
achieved a further success, which turned his own head and that
of his army. (Read up all this episode in any good French
history.) But Venice, trembling for her supremacy, formed a
league against him; and soon after, all Italy, alarmed at his
success, coalesced to repel the invader. The little Republics
united their forces under Giovanni Francesco Gonzaga, Marquis
of Mantua, and met Charles, on the 6th of July, 1495, at the
pass of Fornova, on <span class='bold'>the Taro</span>. The French king, it is true,
forced his way through the hostile army, and made good his
retreat: but the allies, though baffled, claimed the victory, and,
as a matter of fact, Charles immediately concluded a treaty of
peace and returned to Lyons. In commemoration of this event,
the Marquis Gonzaga in gratitude erected a church at Mantua
as a votive offering to the Madonna, and dedicated it under the
name of <span class='bold'>Santa Maria della Vittoria</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that time and for some years previously Mantegna had
been in the service of the <span class='bold'>Gonzaga</span> family at <span class='bold'>Mantua</span>, where
he lived for the greater part of his artistic life. In the Castello
of that town, he executed several frescoes, illustrating domestic
events in the history of the Gonzagas, which are still among
the most interesting objects to be visited in Mantua. It was
natural, therefore, that he should be invited by Giovanni Francesco
Gonzaga to paint the altar-piece for the high altar of the
church to commemorate this victory. The picture must have
been finished about the year 1498 or 1500. It stood in the
building for which it was painted till Napoleon I brought it
from Italy to Paris, where it has ever since remained.
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>These circumstances sufficiently explain the <span class='bold'>collection of
saints</span> who figure in the picture. In the centre is the <span class='bold'>Madonna
of Victory</span> herself, to whom Gonzaga vowed the church in case
he should be successful. She is enthroned, as usual. The
garlands of flowers and fruit, and the coral over her head, are
favourite accessories with Mantegna: they occur again in the
(much earlier) Madonna at San Zeno, Verona, of which the
Crucifixion here formed part of the predella. The figures of
Adam and Eve, in imitation of relief, on the pedestal, are
thoroughly characteristic of Mantegna’s style, and recall the
Paduan school of Squarcione, and the master’s dependence on
the work of Donatello. The overloading of the picture with
flowers, festoons and architectural decoration is also a Paduan
feature of the same school: it comes out equally in the works
of Carlo Crivelli—not well seen in this collection. On his
knees in the foreground is <span class='it'>Gonzaga</span> himself, with his villainous
Italian Renaissance face, as of a man who would try to bribe
Our Lady with presents. And indeed Our Lady stretches out
her friendly hand towards him, as if to assure him of favour
and victory. Notice that the Marquis wears his armour: he is
giving thanks, as it were, on the field of battle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As often with Mantegna, the minor characters and saints
are fuller of life than the two central divine personages: his
Madonnas have frequently a tendency to be insipid. On the
left of the picture, flanking the Virgin, stands <span class='bold'>St. Michael the
Archangel</span>, the “warrior of God,” as representing the idea that
the Lord of Hosts fought on the side of the Italian confederacy.
This beautiful figure, clad in refulgent heavenly armour, is one
of the noblest and loveliest that Mantegna ever painted. Compare
it with the two St. Michaels by Raphael, the early one in
the Long Gallery: the later in the Salon Carré: note the
general similarity of type, with the divergence in treatment. A
little behind, again, half seen, stands <span class='bold'>St. Andrew</span>, who was
both Andrea Mantegna’s own namesake, and also one of the
patrons of Mantua. He has an important church dedicated
in his honour in that town—a Renaissance church, by Leon
Battista Alberti: and in this church of his patron, Mantegna
himself is buried. For the altar-piece of this same church,
which he had doubtless selected beforehand for his own last
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>
resting-place, the great artist also painted a representation of
the risen Saviour, with St. Andrew holding the cross of his
martyrdom on one side, and St. Longinus (of whom more
shortly) with his spear on the other. Thus there was every
reason both why St. Andrew should be represented in a picture
painted for the Marquis of Mantua, and why he should more
particularly appear in a work by Andrea Mantegna. As one
of the patron saints of town and painter, he naturally had his
share in the thanksgiving for the victory. His features in this
picture and in the one at Mantua are closely similar. Mantegna,
indeed, imitated an older type, which he made his own, and reproduced
like a portrait. Note that St. Andrew bears a cross
as his symbol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the other side of the Madonna, <span class='bold'>St. Elizabeth</span> kneels in
the foreground, representing, I think, the patron saint of the
Marchesa, Gonzaga’s wife, who was Isabella d’Este, sister of
Duke Alfonso of Ferrara. (Isabella and Elisabeth are always
regarded as variants of the same name.) Now in the chapel of
St. Longinus in the church of St. Andrea at Mantua, aforesaid,
where Mantegna is buried, he also painted a Madonna, with
this same St. Elizabeth, holding the infant St. John Baptist,
while the child Christ blesses him: no doubt a votive offering
from Isabella. Here again we have a type of St. Elizabeth
repeated in this picture. Behind St. Elizabeth stands the exquisitely
wistful <span class='bold'>St. George</span>, the patron saint of the Venetian
territory, representing the part borne by Venice and her dependencies
in the war of expulsion: the patron receives the thanks
of his faithful votaries. (Mrs. Jameson thinks this figure is St.
Maurice, another military saint, and patron of Mantua: comparison
with various St. Georges and St. Maurices elsewhere
makes me disagree with her. Besides, St. George’s lance is
often broken, as here: you can note it so in the Raphael of the
Long Gallery.) In the background stands <span class='bold'>St. Longinus</span>, a
Roman soldier, distinguishable by his lance and antique helmet.
According to tradition, Longinus was the centurion who pierced
the side of Christ: you see him so in the famous Rubens
(called the Coup de Lance) at Antwerp, and in almost every
mediæval Crucifixion or Calvary. (Look out for him in future.)
When he saw the wonders which accompanied the Passion, we
<span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span>
are told in scripture that he exclaimed, “Truly this man was
the Son of God.” Later legend made him be converted, after
being afflicted with sudden blindness, and undergo a singular
voluntary martyrdom. His relics were brought to Mantua in
the 11th century, and he has ever since been the chief patron
saint of that city. Mantegna painted him often, and sometimes
made a type of him. In the picture already described in the
chapel of St. Longinus, he answers, as here, to St. Andrew, and
wears a classical costume, on which the painter has lavished his
usual care and minute accuracy of drawing. Notice him also
in the foreground of Mantegna’s Crucifixion in the Salon Carré,
bearing his spear—where, however, the type is not followed as
usual. Thus not one of the characters grouped around the
Madonna in this exquisite picture is without its full relevancy
and meaning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do not overlook in this military votive offering the preponderance
of soldier saints, and their appearance under arms,
to commemorate the victory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Observe also the way in which St. George and St. Michael
hold the <span class='bold'>Madonna’s mantle</span>, so as to enclose or embrace Gonzaga
and his wife’s patroness, St. Elizabeth. This is a symbol
of the Madonna’s protection: in what is called a Madonna della
Misericordia Our Lady’s robe thus shelters numerous votaries.
So, at Cluny, you will find a sculptured St. Ursula (in Room VI)
sheltering under her mantle as many of the 11,000 Virgins as
the sculptor could manage—as she also does in the Memling at
Bruges.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the <span class='bold'>æsthetic side</span>, note once more the marked distinction
which Mantegna draws between the historical portrait of
the kneeling Gonzaga—a most ruthless ruffian—and the ideal
figures of saints by whom he is surrounded. Remark, again,
the angelic sweetness of the round-faced St. Michael, contrasted
with the purely human look of longing and strife, and the
guarded purity in the countenance of the St. George—who
almost foreshadows Burne-Jones and Rossetti. Observe, too,
how this romantic saint serves as a foil to the practical Roman
Longinus, with his honest and sober face, and his soldierly
sense of duty. Study the melting tones of colour throughout,
and contrast the simple devotional calm of this religious work
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>
with the rapidity and movement of the mundane Mars and
Venus beside it. Do not overlook a single detail; every hand
and foot, every surface of metal, every fruit and flower is worthy
of attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As always, I have only tried here to <span class='bold'>explain</span> this picture, not
to make you <span class='bold'>admire</span> it. But the longer you look at it the more
you will be charmed by its wonderful colour, its poetic grace,
and the exquisite beauty of its drawing and composition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, still in the same connection, go on into the Long Gallery,
and look, near Andrea del Sarto’s Holy Family, at a mannered
and theatrical picture of the <span class='bold'>Nativity</span> by <span class='bold'>Giulio Romano</span>.
This is not a Nativity simple, but one with selected saints looking
on: it was painted for the altar-piece of the altar of the
Chapel of St. Longinus in Sant’ Andrea at Mantua—the same in
which Mantegna had earlier painted the Longinus pictures noted
above. The central portion of this altar-piece consists of a
tolerably conventional Nativity, with the adoring shepherds,
Raphaelized by Giulio Romano (who was Raphael’s favourite
pupil) in accordance with the ideas of the early 16th cent.
(It is interesting to note, by the way, the nature of these modifications.)
In the background is the herald angel appearing to
the shepherds: this scene, prior in time to the other, was often
so represented in the same picture or carving: look out for it
elsewhere, and also for such non-contemporaneous episodes in
general. But the attendant saints, to right and left, looking on
at the sacred scene, are St. John the Evangelist (known by his
chalice and serpent) and <span class='bold'>St. Longinus</span>. The last-named holds
in his hands a crystal vase—a pyx or reliquary, containing the
sacred blood of Christ, which Longinus caught as it fell, and
which was brought with the rest of the relics to <span class='bold'>Mantua</span>, and
preserved in the very chapel for which this picture was intended.
Compare this dull Longinus with the two by Mantegna
in this collection: and when you visit Mantua, remember that
these pictures came from these two churches. By thus interweaving
your facts, you will get a far clearer conception in the
end of <span class='bold'>the connection of art</span> than you can possibly do if you
regard the various works in pure isolation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But what was <span class='bold'>Giulio Romano</span> doing at Mantua? After
Raphael’s death, his pupils were dispersed; and this his favourite
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>
follower settled down in the service of Duke Federigo Gonzaga
(the first Duke—the earlier lords were Marquises), for whom
he decorated the Palazzo del Tè, with its grotesque Titans.
<span class='bold'>Primaticcio</span> and <span class='bold'>Niccolo dell’ Abbate</span>, pupils again of Giulio’s,
were educated at Mantua, and afterwards summoned by François
I<sup>er</sup> to France, where they became the founders of the
<span class='bold'>School of Fontainebleau</span>. They thus passed on the Raphaelesque
traditions into the French capital. It is partly for this
reason that I have selected for my first examples this particular
Mantuan group of paintings, in order that you may realise the
close interaction of French and Italian politics, and the continuity
of the Italian with the French Renaissance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is worth while, too, to enquire <span class='bold'>how</span> the different pictures
<span class='bold'>came into this collection</span>. The Madonna della Vittoria, we
saw, was brought as a trophy of war from Italy by Napoleon.
The Giulio Romano, after hanging for some time in the chapel
at Mantua, for which it was painted, was shortly annexed by the
Duke of Mantua, who sold it to Charles I of England. That king
formed a noble collection of Italian and Flemish works, which,
after his execution, was sold by the Commonwealth for a very
small price to a dealer named Jabach, who in his turn disposed
of most of the pictures to Louis XIV; they formed the nucleus
of the Louvre collection. Look out for these works of which
Puritan England thus deprived herself, and see how considerable
a portion they form of the earlier treasures of this Gallery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lastly, return once more to the Mantegnas in the Salle des
Primitifs, and notice that the so-called Parnassus—that is to say,
the Mars and Venus discovered by Vulcan—as well as the Vices
conquered by Wisdom, and the companion pieces by Perugino
and Costa, were all painted for <span class='bold'>Isabella d’Este-Gonzaga</span>, to
decorate her boudoir at Mantua. Of these works, I think Mantegna’s
are the oldest, and struck the keynote for figures and
treatment. For after Mantegna’s death, the Ferrarese painter,
Costa, was invited from Isabella’s home to become court-painter
at Mantua: and the Perugino is one in that master’s latest
manner, most tinged with the Renaissance. Giulio Romano,
again, succeeded Costa. If you will now compare Mantegna’s
two works in this series with his others in this Gallery, you will
be able to form a clearer conception of his admirable fancy, his
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>
unvarying grace, and his perfect mastery of execution: while if
you contrast them with those by the two contemporary artists—the
Umbrian Perugino and the Ferrarese Costa—you will be
enabled to observe what was the common note of these early
Renaissance masters, and what their distinctive individual characteristics.
In particular, you may notice in these works, when
looked at side by side with those of earlier painters, the enormous
advance Mantegna had made in anatomy and in perspective.
He is the <span class='bold'>scientific painter</span> of Upper Italy, as Leonardo is the
scientific painter of Florence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These four pictures again made their way to the Louvre by a
different route. They were captured at the sack of Mantua in
1630, and originally came to France to decorate the <span class='it'>château</span> of
Cardinal Richelieu.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more, <span class='bold'>Duke Alfonso d’Este</span>, Isabella’s brother, is the
person whom you see in the portrait by Titian in the Salon Carré,
together with his mistress Laura Dianti, painted about 1520.
Familiarity with such facts alone can give you any adequate
idea of the extraordinary rapidity in the development of art and
the modernization of Italy in the 16th century.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>For my next example I will take a quite obscure and unnoticed
picture, also in the Salle des Primitifs, <span class='bold'>Giovanni Massone’s
altar-piece</span> in three compartments, number 261.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Savona is an unimportant little town between Nice and Genoa,
chiefly noteworthy at the present day as the junction for a branch
line to Turin. But in the 15th and 16th centuries it was a flourishing
place, which gave employment to many distinguished
Piedmontese and Lombard artists, the most famous of whom
were Foppa and Brea. It also gave birth to two famous popes,
Sixtus IV and Julius II, the latter of whom is familiar to most
of us from the magnificent portrait by Raphael, three replicas
of which exist, in the Uffizi and the Pitti Palace in Florence,
and in the National Gallery in London. Sixtus IV erected for
himself a superb sepulchral chapel in his native town of Savona:
go and see it, if you pass by there, as well as the modern statue
of the pope erected by his fellow-citizens. From that chapel
this picture, by an otherwise unknown artist, has been abstracted
and brought here. We know its author merely by the signature
<span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>
he has placed on a <span class='it'>cartellino</span> or strip of paper in the picture
itself: Joh[ann]es Mazonus de Alex[andri]a pinxit—shewing
that he was born in the Piedmontese town of Alessandria.
For the rest, he is a mere name to us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The picture itself, by no means a masterpiece, has in its
centre the Nativity, designed in the usual conventional fashion,
and in a somewhat antiquated Lombard style. The Madonna
and St. Joseph have very solid haloes: the action takes place
in a ruined temple, as often, symbolising the triumph of Christianity
over heathendom. In the background are a landscape,
and some pleasing accessories. But the lateral subjects give
it greater interest. In the compartment to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> stands St.
Francis of Assisi, in his usual brown Franciscan robe, as protector
of Sixtus IV, who kneels beside him. Notice this way
of marking the name of a donor, for the pope was Cardinal
Francesco della Rovere. Observe too the stigmata, as far
as visible, and compare this much later figure of St. Francis
with those in the picture by Giotto and its two imitators.
On the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> stands a second Franciscan saint, also in the coarse
brown garb of his order—the same in whose church Andrea
Mantegna studied Donatello, and whom we have seen more
than once during our Parisian excursions holding in his arms
the infant Christ—St. Antony of Padua. He lays his hand
on the shoulder of a second votary—the Cardinal della Rovere,
afterwards the stern and formidable pope, Julius II. If you
know the National Gallery and the Vatican, see whether you
can recognise an earlier stage of the same features which occur
in the famous portrait, and also in the figure of the pope,
borne on the shoulders of his stalwart attendants into the
temple at Jerusalem, in a corner of the famous fresco of the
Expulsion of Heliodorus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Recollect, again, that it was for the tomb of this same Pope
Julius II that Michael Angelo produced the two so-called
Fettered Slaves, which you have seen or will see in the
Renaissance Sculpture Room of this collection. Weave your
knowledge together in this way, till it forms a connected whole,
which enables you far better to understand and appreciate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I call your special attention to this picture, among other
things, for its historical rather than its artistic value. But I
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>
want you also to realise that the man who was painted in this
rude and antiquated style in his middle age was painted again
in his declining years by Raphael at the summit of his powers,
and was a patron of the mighty Michael Angelo at the zenith
of his development. This will help to impress upon you better
than anything else the necessity for carefully <span class='bold'>noting chronology</span>,
and will also supply a needed caution that you must
not regard any work as necessarily early on no better ground
than because it is comparatively archaic in style and treatment.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Next inspect the two little companion pictures of <span class='bold'>St. George
and St. Michael</span> by <span class='bold'>Raphael</span>, on the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> wall of the First
Compartment in the Long Gallery. These two small works are
rare examples of Raphael’s very earliest pre-Peruginesque
manner. Morelli has shewn that the great painter was first of
all a pupil of Timoteo Viti at Urbino, his native town. If you
have not visited Bologna and Milan, however, this will tell you
little; for nowhere else can you see Timoteo to any great
advantage; and I may observe here that the best time to visit
the Louvre is <span class='it'>after</span> you have been in Italy, where you ought to
have formed a clear conception of the various masters and
their relations to one another. But you can see at least, on the
face of them, that these two simple and graceful little works
are quite different in style and manner even from the <span class='it'>Belle
Jardinière</span>, and certainly very unlike the much later St. Margaret
which hangs close by them. They are still comparatively
mediæval in tone: they have a definiteness and clearness of
outline which contrasts strongly with the softer melting tones
of Raphael’s later work: they show as yet no tinge of the
affected prettinesses which he learned from Perugino—still less
of his later Florentine and Roman manners. They are painted
on the back of a chess or draught board, and were produced
for Duke Guidobaldo of Urbino about the year 1500.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Look first at the <span class='bold'>St. George</span>. The subject here is the
Combat with the Dragon; and Raphael, in representing it,
has strictly followed the conventional arrangement of earlier
painters. No earlier picture for comparison with his treatment
exists in this Gallery, though there are plenty elsewhere: but
if you will look downstairs at the majolica relief of the same
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>
subject in the Della Robbia Room of the Renaissance Sculpture
Gallery, you will see how closely Raphael’s work corresponds
with earlier representations of the same pretty myth. As you
will now have learned, there is always a regular way to envisage
every stock subject: whoever produced a Combat of St.
George with the Dragon was compelled by custom and the
expectations of his patron to include these various elements—a
St. George in armour, on horseback, the horse usually white,
as here: a wounded dragon, most often to the right: the Princess
running away in terror in the distance, or at least crouching
abjectly. There is a Tintoretto of this subject, indeed, in
the National Gallery, where some critics have blamed the great
Venetian painter for making the Princess look away in terror,
instead of turning with gratitude to thank her brave preserver.
But the conventional representation <span class='it'>demanded</span> that the Princess
should flee or cower: people were accustomed to that treatment
of the theme, and expected always to see it repeated.
It was their notion of a St. George. We must set down a
great deal in early art to this sense of expectation on the part
of patrons. Tintoretto, who came much later than Raphael,
after the mighty Renaissance painters had accustomed the
world to put up with, or even to look for, novelty of composition,
often ventured very largely to depart from traditional
motives. In his picture, therefore, the Princess occupies the
foreground—a most revolutionary proceeding—while the action
itself is relegated somewhat to the middle distance. But if
you compare the three representations of this scene to be found
in the Louvre—this picture and the two reliefs by Della Robbia
and Michel Colombe respectively—you will see that the Princess
in earlier times is always represented quite small in the
distance, and is usually running away, or at best kneeling with
clasped hands in abject terror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Raphael, the dragon is already wounded: but he has
broken the saint’s lance, with part of which he is transfixed,
while the remainder lies in fragments on the ground behind
him. St. George on his prancing steed is drawing his sword
to finish off the monster. In the Michel Colombe, on the other
hand (downstairs in the French Renaissance Sculpture), the
dragon is biting at the lance, which explains why it is broken
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>
here, and also why the St. George in Mantegna’s Madonna
holds a broken shaft as his emblem or symbol. Observe, however,
that while the French sculptor, with questionable taste,
makes the dragon occupy the larger part of the field, so as
somewhat to dwarf St. George and his steed, the Italian
sculptor, and still more the Italian painter, have shewn greater
tact in treating the dragon as a comparative accessory, and
concentrating attention upon the militant saint, combating with
spiritual arms the evil demon. In this picture, as Mrs. Jameson
well observes, the conception is on the whole serenely
allegorical and religious in spirit. But Raphael himself painted
a second St. George, at a later date, for the Duke of Urbino
to present to Henry VII of England. In this other picture,
which is now in the Hermitage at St. Petersburg, St. George is
treated rather as the patron saint of England than as the
Champion of Right—to mark which fact he wears the Order of
the Garter round his knee, with its familiar motto. As Champion
of England, he is rushing on the monster with fiery
energy: the picture is in this case more military than spiritual.
The moment chosen is the one where he is just transfixing the
dragon with his lance: the rescued Princess is here again in
the background.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Note once more that these various works are pictures of the
<span class='bold'>combat</span> of St. George with the Dragon. In <span class='bold'>devotional
pictures</span> of the Madonna, St. George frequently stands by
Our Lady’s side, in accordance with the wishes of the particular
donor, as patron saint of that person himself, or of his
town or family. In Venetian pictures, as we have seen, he is
very frequent, being one of the patron saints of Venice, and
more particularly of the Venetian army and the conquered
territory. You will find it interesting, after you have finished
the examination of the two Raphaels, to go round the devotional
Italian pictures in the Salle des Primitifs, the Long
Gallery, and the Salon Carré, in order to note his various
appearances. He is usually marked by his lance and his
armour: the absence of wings (a point not always noticed by
beginners) will enable you at once to discriminate him from
St. Michael—as man from angel. The more you learn to look
out for such recurrences of saints, and to account for the
<span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>
reasons for their appearance, the more will you understand and
enjoy picture galleries, and the more will you throw yourself
into the devotional mediæval atmosphere which produced such
pictures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now turn to the second little Raphael. This represents the
closely cognate subject of <span class='bold'>St. Michael and the Dragon</span>—the
angelic as opposed to the human counterpart. The two ideas
are at bottom identical—the power of good overcoming evil;
the true faith combating heathendom. It is a world-wide myth,
occurring in many forms—as Horus and Typhon, as Perseus,
as Bellerophon. Hence Michael and George, the superhuman
and the human soldier of right, often balance one another, as
in these two pictures: you have seen them doing so already in
the Madonna della Vittoria: look out for them elsewhere in this
conjunction. Both are knights; both are in armour; but one is
a man and the other an angel. In this second little picture, St.
Michael is seen, clad in his usual gorgeous mail, treading on
the neck of the dragon and menacing it with his sword. The
dark and lurid landscape in the background contains many
fearful forms of uncertain monsters: condemned souls are
plagued in it by demons, while a flaming town flares murkily
towards heaven in the far distance, the details being taken, as
in many such works, from Dante’s Inferno. Or rather, they and
the Inferno represent the same old traditional view of Hades.
(The figures weighed down with leaden cowls are the hypocrites,
while the thieves are tormented by a plague of serpents.)
Close comparison of these two little works will give you a
good idea of Raphael’s earliest Urbino manner. This fantastic
picture, however, though full of imagination, is by no means so
pleasing as the dainty St. George beside it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Go straight from this combat to the <span class='bold'>Great St. Michael</span>, also
by Raphael, in the Salon Carré. It bears date 1518. Pope
Leo X commissioned Raphael to paint this picture as a
present for François I<sup>er</sup>: the painter—to whom he left the choice
of subject—chose St. Michael, the military patron of France,
and of the Order of which the king was Grand Master. (You
will find a bronze bust of François, wearing the collar and
pendant of St. Michael, in the Renaissance Sculpture.) He
chose it also, no doubt, because it enabled him to show his
<span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span>
increased mastery over life and action. This great and noble
picture, one of the finest as regards dramatic rapidity ever
painted by Raphael, is celebrated for the instantaneous effect
of its movement. (Compare the demoniac boy in the Transfiguration
at the Vatican.) The warrior archangel has just
swooped down through the air, and, hovering on poised wings,
is caught in the very act of setting one foot lightly on the
demon’s shoulder. The dragon, writhing, tries in vain to lift
his head and turn on his conqueror. The noble serenity of the
archangel’s face, the perfect grace of his form and attitude, the
brilliant panoply of his celestial armour, the sheen of his
wings, the light tresses of his hair floating outward behind him
(as of one who has traversed space on wings of lightning) cannot
fail to be remarked by every spectator. This is Raphael in
the fulness of his knowledge and power, yet far less interesting
to the lover of sacred art than the boy Raphael of Urbino, the
dreamy Raphael of the Sposalizio at Milan, the tender Raphael
of the Gran Duca at Florence, or of the Belle Jardinière in this
same apartment. Notice that with the progress of Renaissance
feeling the demon is now no longer a dragon but a half-human
figure, with horns and serpent tail, and swarthy red in colour.
He is so foreshortened as not to take up any large space in the
composition, which is mainly filled by the victorious figure of
the triumphant archangel. The more classical armour bespeaks
the High Renaissance. The longer you compare these
two extreme phases of Raphael’s art, the more will you note
points of advance between them—technical advance, counterbalanced
by moral and spiritual retrogression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>End by comparing this St. Michael with Mantegna’s, and
with the playful Leonardesque archangel in the <span class='it'>Vierge aux
balances</span>, the last point in the degeneracy of a celestial conception.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Raphael is one of the painters who can best be studied at the
Louvre, with comparatively little need for aid from elsewhere.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Pay a special visit to the Louvre one day in order to make a
<span class='bold'>detailed study of Madonnas</span>. Before doing so, however, read
and digest the following general statement of principles on the
subject.
<span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>[People who have not thrown themselves, or thought themselves,
or read themselves into the mental attitude of early art,
often complain that Italian picture galleries, and museums like
Cluny, are too full of merely sacred subjects. But when once
you have learnt to understand and appreciate them, to know
the meaning which lurks in every part, you will no longer make
this causeless complaint. As well object to Greek art that it
represents little save the personages of Greek mythology. As a
matter of fact, though the Louvre contains a fair number of
Madonnas, it does not embrace a sufficient number to give a
perfectly clear conception of the varieties of type and the
development of the subject—not so good a series in many
respects as the National Gallery, though it is particularly well
adapted for the study of certain special groups, particularly the
Leonardesque-Lombard development.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The simplest type of Madonna is that where <span class='bold'>Our Lady</span>
appears <span class='bold'>alone</span> with the Divine Infant. This modification of
the subject most often occurs as a half-length, though sometimes
the Blessed Virgin is so represented in full length, enthroned, or
under a canopy. Several such simple Madonnas occur in the
Gallery. In the earliest examples here, however, such as
Cimabue’s, and the cognate altar-piece of the School of Giotto,
the Madonna is seen surrounded by angelic supporters. This
forms a second group—<span class='bold'>Our Lady with Angels</span>. Very early
examples of this treatment show the angels in complete isolation,
as a sort of framework. (See several parallels in sculpture
in Room VI, ground floor, at Cluny.) Grouping as yet is non-existent.
No specimen of this very original type is to be found
in the Louvre; but in the Cimabue of this Gallery the angels
are superimposed, so to speak, while in the Giottesque example
close by an elementary attempt is made at grouping them. In
later works, the angels are more and more naturally represented,
from age to age, singly or in pairs, or else grouped irregularly
on either side of Our Lady. You will note for yourself that as
the Renaissance developes, the nature of the grouping, both of
angels and saints, deviates more and more from the early strict
architectural symmetry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A slight variant on the simple pictures of the Madonna and
Child are those, of Florentine origin, in which the <span class='bold'>infant St.</span>
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>
<span class='bold'>John Baptist</span>, the patron Saint of the City of Florence, is
introduced at play with the childish Saviour. This class—the
<span class='bold'>Madonna and Child, with St. John</span>—is well represented
in the <span class='it'>Belle Jardinière</span>, and several other pictures in the
Louvre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most often, however, the Madonna is seen enthroned, in the
centre of the altar-piece or composition, and surrounded by one,
two, or three pairs of saintly personages. The <span class='bold'>Madonna with
Saints</span> thus forms a separate group of subjects. These saints,
you will by this time have gathered, are <span class='it'>never</span> arbitrarily introduced.
They were selected and commissioned, as a rule, by the
purchaser, and they are there for a good and sufficient reason.
Often the donor desired to pay his devotion in this fashion to
his own personal patron; often to the patron of his town or
village, of the church in which the picture was to be deposited,
or of his family or relations. Frequently, again, the picture
was a <span class='bold'>votive offering</span>, as against plague or other dreaded
calamity: in which case it is apt to contain figures of the great
plague saints, Roch and Sebastian. Ignorant people often
object that such sets of saints are not contemporary. They
forget that this is the Enthroned Madonna, and that the action
takes place in the Celestial City, where the saints surround
the throne of Our Lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As regards <span class='bold'>grouping</span>, in the earlier altar-pieces the selected
saints were treated in complete isolation. Most often the
Madonna and Child occupy in such cases a central panel,
under its own canopy; while the saints are each enclosed in a
separate little alcove or gilded tabernacle. Reminiscences of
this usage linger long in Italy. Later on, as art progressed,
painters began to feel the stiffness of such an arrangement:
they placed the attendant saints at first in regularly disposed
pairs on either side the throne, and afterwards in something
approaching a set <span class='bold'>composition</span>. With the High Renaissance,
the various figures, instead of occupying mere posts round the
seat of Our Lady, and gazing at her in adoration, began to indulge
in conversation with one another, or to take part in some
more or less animated and natural action. This method of
arrangement, which culminates for the Florentine school in Fra
Bartolommeo, degenerates with the Decadence into confused
<span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>
and muddled groups, with scarcely a trace of symbols—groups
of well-draped models, in which it is impossible to see any sacred
significance. The <span class='bold'>Florentine</span> painters preferred, as a rule,
such rather complex grouping: the <span class='bold'>Venetians</span>, influenced in
great part by the severer taste of Giorgione and of Titian,
usually show a more simple arrangement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Any one of these various types of Madonna may also be
modified by the introduction of a <span class='bold'>kneeling donor</span>. Thus,
Van Eyck’s glowing picture of the Chancellor Rollin adoring
Our Lady is an example of the simple Madonna and Child,
enthroned, accompanied by the donor; though in this case,
the composition is further slightly enriched by the dainty little
floating angel in the background, who places an exquisitely
jewelled crown of the finest Flemish workmanship on the head
of the Virgin. The Madonna della Vittoria, again, which we
have so fully considered, is essentially a Madonna and Saints,
with the kneeling donor. In very early pictures, you will
observe that the donors are often painted grotesquely small,
while Our Lady and the Saints are of relatively superhuman
stature, to mark their superiority as heavenly personages. In
later works, this absurdity dies out, and the figure and face of
the donor become one of the recognised excuses for early
portrait painting. Indeed, portraiture took its rise for the
modern world from such kneeling figures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another point of view from which it is interesting to compare
these various Madonnas is that of the <span class='bold'>Nationality</span> or <span class='bold'>School
of Art</span> to which they belong. The <span class='bold'>early Italian</span> representations
of Our Lady are usually more or less girlish in appearance,
refined in features, and comparatively simple in dress
and decoration. The Flemish type is peculiarly insipid, one
might often say, even with great artists, inane and meaningless;
in the hands of minor painters, it becomes positively wooden.
The face here is long and rather thin; the features peaky.
The Madonna of Flemish art, indeed, like the Christ of all
art, is a sacred type which is seldom varied. <span class='bold'>Early French</span>
Madonnas, once more, are regal and ladylike, sometimes even
courtly. They wear crowns as queens, and are better observed
in the Louvre in sculpture than in painting. This Gallery hardly
suffices to note in full the peculiarities of the <span class='bold'>sub-types</span> in
<span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>
various <span class='bold'>Italian schools</span>; but they may still be recognised. Of
these, the <span class='bold'>Florentine</span> are spiritual, delicate, and strongly ideal;
the <span class='bold'>Lombard</span>, intellectual, like well-read ladies; the <span class='bold'>Venetian</span>,
stately and matronly oligarchical mothers, degenerating later
into the mere aristocratic nobility, soulless and materialised, of
Titian and his followers. The <span class='bold'>Umbrians</span> and <span class='bold'>Sienese</span> are
distinguished for the most part by their pure and saintly air
of fervent piety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do not confound with any of these <span class='bold'>devotional Madonnas</span>,
with or without select groups of saints, various other classes
of picture which somewhat resemble them. Each of these has
in early art its own proper convention and treatment: it was a
recognised species. A <span class='bold'>Holy Family</span>, for example, consists, as
a rule, of a Madonna, the Infant Christ, St. Joseph, St. Elizabeth,
and the child Baptist. Like the other subjects, it is
sometimes complicated by the addition of selected Saints as
spectators or assessors. A <span class='bold'>Coronation of the Virgin</span>, again,
is an entirely celestial scene, taking place in the calm of the
heavenly regions. The Madonna is usually crowned by her
Son, but sometimes by angels or by the Eternal Father.
(Several interesting examples of this, for comparison, occur in
Room VI, ground floor, at Cluny.) <span class='bold'>Nativities</span>, of course,
belong rather to the group of pictorial histories, such as the
Life of Christ, or the Seven Joys of Mary. The sculptures in
the ambulatory at Notre-Dame give one a good idea of such
continuous histories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One interesting set of Madonnas, largely exemplified here,
to take a particular example, is the later Lombard type of the
<span class='bold'>School of Leonardo</span>. This type, well distinguished by its
regular oval features, its gentle smile of inner happiness, and
its peculiar waving hair with wisps over the shoulders, is
usually regarded as essentially belonging to Leonardo himself
and his immediate followers. It is foreshadowed, however, by
Foppa, Borgognone, and other early Lombard painters, specimens
of whom are not numerous in the Louvre. Leonardo,
when he came to Milan to Ludovico Sforza, adopted this local
type, which he transfused with Florentine grace and with his
own peculiar subdued smile, as one sees it already in the Mona
Lisa. From Leonardo, again, it was taken, with more or less
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>
success, by his immediate pupils, Beltraffio, Solario, Cesare di
Sesto, and others, as well as by Luini, who was not a pupil of
Leonardo himself, but who was deeply influenced by the master’s
methods and his works in Milan. The number of these
Leonardesque Madonnas in the Louvre is exceptionally great,
while Leonardo himself can here be better estimated than in
Italy. Nowhere else perhaps, save possibly at Milan, can
this type as a whole be compared by the student to so great
advantage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the Madonna herself usually occupies the central
panel of votive pictures, it sometimes happens that some
<span class='bold'>other saint</span> is, on his own altar-piece, similarly enthroned;
and in that case he is flanked by brother saints, often more
important in themselves, but then and there subordinated to
him. This special honour under special circumstances is well
seen in the case of the St. Lawrence at the far end of the Salle
des Primitifs. Particular local saints often thus receive what
might otherwise appear undue recognition. For the same
reason, minor saints in the group surrounding a Madonna often
obtain local brevet-rank (if I may be allowed the simile) over
others of far greater general dignity, which they could not lay
claim to in any other connection. Thus, in the Nativity by
Giulio Romano, to which I called attention in connection with
Mantegna’s Madonna, St. Longinus (with his crystal vase) stood
on Our Lady’s <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, while St. John was relegated to her <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>—a
subordination of the greater to the lesser saint which would
only be possible in a chapel actually dedicated to St. Longinus,
and where he receives peculiar honour. I now propose to
escort you round a few rooms of the Louvre, again calling
attention very briefly, from this point of view, to certain special
Madonna features only.]</p>

</div>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Now, go to the Louvre and test these remarks. Begin at
the far end of the Salle des Primitifs. The Cimabue and the
Giottesque of the Madonna and Angels we have already considered.
Compare them again from our present standpoint.
Close to them on the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, beneath the large Giotto of St.
Francis, are two pretty little Madonnas, 1620 (I now give the
large upper numbers alone) and 1667. The first of these
<span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>
exhibits below two tiny votaries—the small-sized donors—a
Franciscan monk and a Dominican nun, with the robes of
their orders; the centre consists of St. Paul and St. Catherine,
as the attendant saints on the large Enthroned Virgin. The
second has the choir of angels, both surrounding and beneath
the throne, with St. Peter (keys), St. Paul (sword), St. John
Baptist (camel-hair) and St. Stephen or St. Vincent (robed as
deacon). St. Peter and St. Paul in 1625 are similar figures,
once surrounding a central panel, with the Madonna now
missing. Compare with this 1666, with its Enthroned Madonna
of the early almond-eyed type, its group of angels round the
throne, and its two saints at the base, John Baptist and Peter.
Observe that the types of these also can be recognised. Each
saint has regular features of his own, which you can learn to
know quite as well as the symbols.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Higher up, 1664, another Madonna and Child, Enthroned,
with similar angels, but with the addition of the figure of St
Catherine of Alexandria, on whose finger the Christ is placing
a ring. This is an early intermediate type of the Marriage
of St. Catherine, hardly yet characterized. Most of these
Madonnas have the characteristic softness and peculiar cast of
countenance of the early School of Siena.</p>

<p class='pindent'>1279, Gentile da Fabriano, is almost a simple Madonna and
Child, but for the addition of the smaller donor, Pandolfo
Malatesta, Lord of Rimini. This picture shows the bland and
round-faced Umbrian type which is closely allied to that of
Siena. Both Schools are remarkable for the fervent pietism
which blossomed out in full in St. Francis of Assisi and St.
Catherine of Siena.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the beautiful Perugino above, 1564, note the complete
transformation in the later Umbrian school of the adoring
angels into a graceful pair, and the beginning of an attempt to
group in comparatively natural attitudes the accompanying
saints, Rose and Catherine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This feature is still more marked in 1565, also Perugino,
(but later) where the Baptist and St. Catherine, well composed,
are thrown into the background behind the Madonna.
Observe that while earlier piety drapes the Child, in Gentile
and still more in Perugino, the growing love for the nude
<span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>
begins to exhibit itself. A study of haloes is also interesting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the opposite or <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> side, 1315 is a good example of the
simple Enthroned Madonna of the School of Giotto. Compare
it with that next it, 1316, where the angels are grouped
with some attempt at composition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>1397, by Neri di Bicci, is also a characteristic half-length
simple Madonna, with the Child still draped after the earlier
fashion affected by this belated follower of Giottesque models.</p>

<p class='pindent'>1345, beneath it, by Filippo Lippi or his school, shows a
characteristic type of features which this painter introduced,—a
modification of the older Florentine ideal: the face is said
to be that of his model Lucrezia Buti, the nun with whom he
eloped and whom he was finally permitted to marry. The
angels in the background show well the rapid advance in the
treatment of these accessories. Observe, as you pass, their
Florentine lilies. Their features are like those of the Medici
children, as seen in numerous works at Florence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1295, by Botticelli, we get that individual painter’s peculiar
mystical and somewhat languid type, while the angels are
again like Medici portraits. Study these Botticellis for his
artistic personality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>1344, by Filippo Lippi, next to it, exhibits Filippo’s very
rounded faces, both in Madonna and angels. The type is more
human. Here, again, we have the Florentine lily borne by
the adoring choir, whose position should be compared as a
faint lingering reminiscence of that in the Giottesques and
the great Cimabue. Observe, at the same time, the division
of the painting as a whole into three false compartments, a
suggestion from the earlier type of altar-piece. At the Madonna’s
feet are two adoring saints, difficult to identify—Florentine
and local, probably. Do not fail to gaze close at the
characteristic baby cherubs, perhaps Lucrezia’s. This picture
should be compared in all its details with earlier pictures of
angel choirs. It is a lovely work. Its delicate painting is
strongly characteristic. The relief of the faces should be
specially noted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Botticelli next it, 1296, introduces us to the infant St.
John of Florence whom we meet again in the <span class='it'>Belle Jardinière</span>
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>
of Raphael’s Florentine period. Another young St. John close
by is full of suggestions of Donatello in the Sculpture Gallery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>493, above the last but one, is a very characteristic Madonna
of the Florentine school, closely resembling the type of
Botticelli. This once more is a simple Madonna and Child,
without accessories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1662, the sanctity has almost disappeared and we get
scarcely more than a purely human mother and baby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the opposite side, 4573, is a half-length by Perugino, the
affected pose of whose neck and the character of whose face
you will now recognise; the Madonna floats in an almond-shaped
glory of cherubs, which indicates her ascent to heaven.
Several similar subjects exist in sculpture at Cluny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>1540, Lo Spagna, is again a simple half-length Madonna,
whose purely Umbrian type recalls both Perugino and the
earlier examples. Compare the Peruginos, Raphaels, and Lo&nbsp;Spagnas
here, and form from them some conception of the
Umbrian ideal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the Bellini beside it I have already spoken sufficiently.
Observe, here, the absolute nudity of the Child, and the reduction
of the angels to sweet little cherub heads among clouds in
the background. The graceful arrangement of the attendant
saints strikes a Bellini keynote: it was followed in later
developments of this subject by Venetian painters. Such half-lengths
are common among the School of Bellini.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The treatment by Cima, 1259, introducing landscape, and
the peculiarly high Venetian throne, is one of a sort also very
frequent for full-length Madonnas at Venice and in the
Venetian territory. The grouping of the saints, also, is here
transitional. Compare it with the exquisite Lorenzo di Credi
opposite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the opposite wall, 1367, by Mainardi, shows us a Florentine
face, the St. John of Florence, and the typical sweet-faced
Florentine angels, holding lilies; in the background, a
view of the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cosimo Rosseli’s, 1482, has again the almond-shaped glory
of cherubs, the nude Child, the typical Florentine face (which
you may now recognise) and also characteristic Florentine
angels; but its St. Bernard and the Magdalen are introduced
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>
on clouds after a somewhat novel fashion. The St. Bernard
is writing down his vision of the Madonna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have already called attention to the beautiful grouping in
1263 by Lorenzo di Credi; but observe now that the exquisite
attendant saints, almost statuesque in their clear-cut isolation,
still show a reminiscence of the earlier arrangement in tabernacles
by the Renaissance archways at their back, combined
with the niche in which the Madonna is enthroned. Only by
the light of Giottesque examples can we understand the
composition of this glorious picture. We do not know the
circumstances under which it was produced: but St. Julian
was the patron saint of Rimini, as St. Nicolas was of Bari.
Both these towns were great Adriatic ports: and I believe it
was painted for a merchant of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do not be content in any of these cases with observing
merely the points to which I call definite attention; try to
compare each work throughout in all its details with others like
it. The evolution of the grouping, in fact, will give you endless
hints as to the history and development of the art of composition.
This picture of Lorenzo’s may be regarded as exemplifying
the finest stage in such works: those of later date are less
pure and severe—show a tendency to confusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This will be quite enough to occupy you for one day. Another
morning, proceed into the Long Gallery, where you can
similarly compare the High Renaissance types and the Leonardesque
Madonnas of the later School of Lombardy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the little Madonna of the School of Francia, 1437, observe
the position of the attendant saint, the new type of face proper
to the art of Bologna, and the way in which, as often, the
infant Christ is poised on a parapet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>1553, by Garofalo, shows a later and softer development of a
somewhat similar (Ferrarese) type; but the Child, instead of
blessing with his two fingers as in most early cases, here
displays the growing Renaissance love of variety and novelty:
he is asleep in his cradle. Observe his attitude in this and
other instances. With all these changes, however, you cannot
fail to be struck by the fairly constant persistence of the red
tunic and the blue mantle of the Madonna, as well as by the
nature of her head-dress in each great School. Never fail to
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>
observe the characteristic head-dresses in the various Schools
of Italian art. They will help you, like the faces, to form types
for comparison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>1353, by Luini, introduces us at once to the Lombard-Leonardesque
class of face and hair. Compare it closely with
the Madonnas in the frescoes in the Salle Duchâtel. The
introduction of Joseph makes this in essence a Holy Family.
Note Luini’s development of the halo of Christ, cruciform in
early cases, or composed of a cross inscribed in a circle, into a
cross-like arrangement of rays of light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two works by Marco da Oggiono, close by, betray similar
types, far inferior to Luini’s, with further loss of primitive
reverence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1181, Borgognone’s Presentation, an earlier Lombard
work, the Madonna faintly foreshadows this Leonardesque type,
though the Leonardesque features are far less markedly present
than in many other examples by this silvery painter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>1530, by Solario, the famous Madonna of the Green Cushion,
may be compared with those by Marco da Oggiono, which it
resembles in motive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1599, La Vierge aux Rochers, we get Leonardo’s own
personal type, which is also seen in the Madonna and St. Anne
of the Salon Carré. Compare all these with the Mona Lisa,
for touch and spirit. Then continue your examination through
the rest of this room with the Leonardesque types: after which,
turn to the School of Venice, beyond them, and note the
evolution of the Titianesque types from the primitive Venetians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the opposite side of the same room, observe, once more,
how Fra Bartolommeo and his School arranged their extremely
complex groups of saints into a composition resembling a state
ceremonial. From this point on in the evolution of the Santa
Conversazione you will see that the arrangement of the saints
entirely loses all sense of sacred meaning. Artificial ecstasies
replace natural piety. An attempt to be artistic, and a desire
to introduce a mode of treatment fitter for the theatre than for
the church, at last entirely obscure the original meaning of
these groups, which are so full of ardour in Fra Angelico, so
full of stateliness in Lorenzo di Credi.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another day may well be devoted to the quaintly girlish
<span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>
Madonnas of the <span class='bold'>Flemish School</span>. Begin by observing carefully
the Van Eyck of the Salon Carré, which is a Madonna
with donor, and the Memling of the Salle Duchâtel, which is a
Madonna with donors, not one with saints; the patrons here
being merely brought in to introduce the votaries to Our Lady’s
notice. From these, proceed to the Early Flemish section of
the Long Gallery, and note in detail the evolution of the type in
later pictures. I need hardly call attention to the Flemish love
for crowns, jewellery, and costly adjuncts. These reflect the
wealthy burgher life of Bruges, Ghent, and Antwerp. The
translucent colour of the Flemish painters, too, lends itself well
to these decorative elements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The best example of an <span class='bold'>Early French Madonna</span> is the
beautiful one which hangs by the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> hand side of the door in
the Salon Carré, leading into the Salle Duchâtel. This
exquisite figure, a true masterpiece of its School, should be
compared with later French developments in painting, as well
as with the admirable collection of plastic works of this School
in the Renaissance Sculpture Gallery down stairs. With these
may also be mentioned, as a typical French example, the famous
miracle-working Notre-Dame-de-Paris, a statue of the thirteenth
or fourteenth century, which stands under a canopy against the
pillar by the entrance to the choir in the south transept of
Notre-Dame, and is popularly regarded as the statue of Our
Lady to which the church is dedicated. The close connection
between royalty and religion in France, well exemplified in the
number of saints of the royal house at St. Germain l’Auxerrois,
St. Germain-des-Prés, St. Denis, and elsewhere, is markedly
exhibited in the extremely regal and high-bred character always
given to French Madonnas. The Florentine, which form in
this respect the greatest contrast, are often envisaged as
idealised peasant girls, full of soul and fervour, but by no means
exalted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, note as far as is possible with the few materials in
this collection, the round-faced, placid type of the <span class='bold'>German
Madonna</span>—placid when at rest, though contorted (as the Mater
Dolorosa) with exaggerated anguish. The fine wooden statue in
the room of the Limoges enamels at Cluny will help to strike the
key-note for this somewhat domestic national ideal. The early
<span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>
German Madonna is as often as not just a glorified housewife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many other subjects for similar comparative treatment may
be found in the Louvre. Pick out for yourself a special theme,
such as, for example, the Adoration of the Magi, the Nativity,
the Presentation in the Temple, or the Agony in the Garden,
and try to follow it out through various examples. Choose also
a saint or two, and pursue them steadily through their evolution.
Do not think that to examine paintings in this way is to be
absorbed by the subject rather than by the art of the painter.
Only superficial observers fall into this error. You will find on
the contrary that the characteristics of each School and of each
artist can best be discovered and observed by watching how
each modifies or alters pre-existing and conventional conceptions.
In order to thoroughly understand any early picture,
you must look at it first as a representation of such-and-such <span class='bold'>a
given subject</span>, for which a relatively fixed and conventional set
of figures or accessories was prescribed by tradition. The number
and minuteness of the prescribed accessories will grow upon
you as you watch them. You have then to observe how <span class='bold'>each
School as a whole</span> treats such works; what feeling it introduces,
towards what sort of modification in style or tone it usually tends.
Next, you must consider it relatively to <span class='bold'>its age</span>, as exemplifying
a particular stage in the progress of the science and art of
painting. Last of all you must carefully estimate what peculiarities
are due to the taste, the temperament, the hand, and
the technique of the <span class='bold'>individual artist</span>. For example, Gerard
David’s Marriage at Cana is thoroughly Flemish in all its
details; while Paolo Veronese’s is thoroughly Venetian. You
may notice the Flemish and Venetian hand, not merely in
the figures and the composition as a whole, but even in the
extraordinarily divergent treatment of such details as the jars
in the foreground, which for David are painted with Flemish
daintiness of detail, though coarse and rough in themselves;
while Veronese approaches them with Venetian wealth of
Renaissance fancy, both in decoration and handling. But the
David, again, is not merely Flemish: it has the distinctive
marks of that particular Fleming, and should be compared with
his lovely portrait of a kneeling donor with his three patron
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span>
saints in the National Gallery: while the Veronese is noticeable
for the voluptuousness, the over-richness, the dash and spirit,
of that large free master of the full Renaissance, the Rubens
by comparison among the Venetians of his time. So too, if
you study attentively the Botticellis in the Salle des Primitifs,
you can notice a close similarity of type in many of his faces
with the types in certain pictures by Filippo Lippi and still
more in those by other Florentines of the same period; while
you are yet even more distinctly struck by the intense individuality
and refined spiritual feeling of this very original and soulful
master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In order to study the Louvre aright, in short, you must be
<span class='bold'>continually comparing</span>. In a word, regard each work, first,
as a representation of such-and-such a subject, falling into its
proper place in the evolution of its series: second, as belonging
to such-and-such a school or nationality: third, as representing
such-and-such an age in the historical evolution of
the art of painting: fourth, as exhibiting the individuality, the
style, the characteristics, the technique, and the peculiar touch
of such-and-such an individual painter. Only thus can you
study art aright in this or any other gallery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Try this method on Van Eyck’s Madonna, on Titian’s Entombment,
on Sebastiano del Piombo’s Visitation, and on
Memling’s little John Baptist, which is one attendant saint
from a triptych whose Madonna is missing.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Some other time, consider in detail the two delicately
luminous <span class='bold'>frescoes by Luini</span>, in the Salle Duchâtel. Before
doing so, however, read on the spot the following remarks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have spoken here for the most part from the point of
view of those visitors who have not travelled much in Italy
or the Low Countries. And, as a matter of fact, the Louvre
is the first great picture gallery on the Continent visited
by nine out of ten English or Americans. In reality, however,
since this collection contains several isolated masterpieces
of all the great schools, together with several
unconnected pictures of minor artists, it requires, almost
more than any other great gallery, to be seen by the light
of information acquired elsewhere. It ought, therefore, to be
<span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>
examined <span class='it'>after</span> as well as, and even more than, <span class='it'>before</span> visits
to other countries. This collection, for example, includes
works by Van Eyck, by Memling, by Giotto, by Fra Angelico.
But Van Eyck can only be fully understood by those who
have visited Ghent; Memling can only be fully understood
by those who have visited Bruges: it is impossible really
to comprehend Giotto unless you have seen his great series
of frescoes in the Madonna dell’ Arena at Padua: it is
impossible really to comprehend Fra Angelico unless you
have examined the saintly and ecstatic works at San Marco
in Florence. Thus you have to bear in mind that the
works in the Louvre are only <span class='bold'>stray examples</span> of masters
and schools with whom an adequate acquaintance must be
obtained elsewhere. It was for this reason that I began
these notes with special examples of Mantegna, because he
is one of the very few artists, other than French, of whom
you can form some tolerably fair conception in Paris alone,
to be pieced out afterwards by observation in Italy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Furthermore, it must be recollected that many artists can
only be seen to advantage under the <span class='bold'>conditions amid which</span>
their works were produced. This is especially the case
with the Italian painters of the 14th and 15th centuries.
They were <span class='bold'>a school of fresco-painters</span>. Their altar-pieces
and other separate panels give but a very inadequate idea
of their powers, and especially of their composition. Giotto
and Fra Angelico, in particular, cannot possibly be estimated
aright by any of their works to be seen north of the Alps.
The altar-pieces, being more especially sacred in character,
were relatively very fixed in type: they allowed of less
variation, less incident, less action, than the histories of
saints which frequently form the subjects of frescoes. You
can judge of this to a slight extent in the Louvre itself, by
comparing the Madonnas at the far end of the Salle des
Primitifs with Giotto’s St. Francis which hangs by: for the
Madonna was the most sacred and therefore the most
bound by custom of any type. You will at once observe
how much freer and more naturalistic is the treatment in
the episode of the Stigmata than in the comparatively wooden
figures of Our Lady by which it is surrounded. Still more
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>
is this the case when we come to compare any of these
altar-pieces with frescoes such as those of the Arena at
Padua, or Santa Croce at Florence. Similarly with Fra
Angelico: the little crowded works which he produced as
altar-pieces give a totally different conception of his character
and powers than that which we derive from the large and
relatively spacious frescoes at San Marco, or in Pope
Nicolas’s Chapel at the Vatican. In such works, we see him
expand into a totally different manner. Now frescoes, by
their very nature, cannot easily be removed from the walls
of churches without great danger. Therefore, the school of
fresco-painters—that is to say, the Early Italian school—is
ill represented outside Italy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Luini, though he belongs to the 16th century, and
though he produced some of his most beautiful works as
cabinet or panel pictures, was yet almost as essentially a
painter in fresco as Fra Angelico or Ghirlandajo. He can
best be appreciated in Milan and its neighbourhood. And
I will add a few notes here for the benefit of those who
know Italy, and who can recall the works they have seen
in that country. At the Brera in Milan, an immense number
of his frescoes, cut out from churches, can be seen and
compared to great advantage. Everybody who has visited
that noble gallery must recall at least the exquisite figure of
St. Catherine placed in her sarcophagus by angels, as well
as the lovely Madonna with St. Antony and St. Barbara,
where the face and beard of the aged anchorite somewhat
recall the treatment of the old bearded king in the Adoration
of the Magi in this gallery. Still better can Luini’s work be
understood by those who know the Sanctuary at Saronno,
where a splendid series of his frescoes still exists on the
wall of the great church in which they were painted. The
two frescoes here in the Salle Duchâtel are not quite so fine
either as those at Saronno or as the very best examples
among the collection at the Brera. Nevertheless, they are
beautiful and delicately-toned specimens of Luini’s work, and,
if studied in conjunction with other pictures by the same
artist in the adjoining rooms, they will serve to give a
tolerably just conception of his style and genius.
<span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Luini is essentially a <span class='bold'>Leonardesque painter</span>. He was not
actually a pupil of Leonardo; but like all other Lombard artists
of his time, he was deeply influenced by the temperament and
example of the Florentine master. If you wish to see the kind
of work produced by the Lombard school <span class='it'>before</span> it had undergone
this quickening influence of Leonardo,—been Tuscanised
and Leonardised—look at the Borgognones in the Long Gallery.
These, again, are not at all satisfactory specimens of that
tender, delicate, and silvery colourist. To appreciate Borgognone
as he ought to be appreciated, however, you must have
seen him at home in the Certosa di Pavia: though even those
who know only his exquisitely spiritual altar-piece of the
Madonna with the two St. Catherines (of Alexandria and Siena)
in the National Gallery will recognise how inadequately his
work is represented by the specimens in the Louvre. Nevertheless,
these examples, inferior though they be in style and
feeling, will serve fairly well to indicate the point to which art
had attained in Lombardy <span class='it'>before</span> the advent of Leonardo. I
need not point out their comparatively archaic character, and
their close following of earlier methods and motives. Again, if
you compare with Borgognone the subsequent group of Leonardesque
painters,—Solario and his contemporaries,—whose
works hang close by on the left-hand wall of the Long Gallery,
you will see how immense was the change which Leonardo
introduced into Lombard art. From his time forward, the
Leonardesque face, the peculiar smile, the crimped wisps of
hair, the subtle tones of colour, and as far as possible the touch
and technique of the master, are reproduced over and over
again by the next generation of Milanese painters. Among
them all, Luini stands preeminently forward as the only one
endowed with profound original genius, capable of transfusing
the Leonardesque types with new vitality and beauty of his own
conceiving. The others are imitators: Luini is a disciple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These attributes are well seen in the two beautiful frescoes of
the Salle Duchâtel. They came to Paris from the Palazzo Litta,
that handsome rococo palace in Milan which stands nearly
opposite the church of San Maurizio, itself a museum of Luini’s
loveliest frescoes, including the incomparable Execution of St.
Catherine. The Adoration of the Magi is the most satisfactory
<span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>
of the two. In it the kings,—Caspar, Melchior, Balthasar,—representing,
as ever, the three ages of man and the three old
continents,—are treated with a grace and soul and delicacy
which Luini has hardly surpassed even at Saronno. The eldest
king, as most often, kneels next to the Madonna, who occupies
the conventional <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> hand of the picture. He has removed his
crown, also an habitual feature, and is presenting his gift, while
the others are caught just before the act of offering theirs. The
exquisite face of this eldest king is highly typical; so is the
gently-smiling Leonardesque Madonna. The youngest king is
represented as a Moor, as always in German, Flemish, and
North Italian art, though this trait is rarer, if it occurs at all, in
the Florentine and Central Italian painters. I take it that the
notion of the Moor was derived from Venice; for the Three
Kings were great objects of devotion in Lombardy and the
Rhine country. Their relics, which now repose at Cologne,
made a long stay on their way from the East at Milan; and it
is to this fact, I fancy, that we must attribute the exceptional
frequency of this subject in the art of Northern Italy, as of the
Rhenish region. In the background, the usual caravans are
seen descending the mountain. Such long trains of servants
and attendants are commonly seen in Adorations of the Magi.
Camels and even elephants frequently form part of them.
Recollect the charming procession in the exquisite Benozzo
Gozzoli in the Riccardi Palace. A study of this subject, from
the simple beginnings in Giotto’s fresco in the Arena at
Padua (where a single servant and a very grotesque camel,
entirely evolved out of the painter’s imagination, form the sole
elements of the cortège; beyond the Three Kings), down to the
highly complex Ghirlandajo in the Uffizi at Florence, (a good
copy of which may be seen at the École des Beaux-Arts,) and
thence to Luini, Bonifazio and the later Italians, forms a most
interesting subject for the comprehension of the historical
evolution of art in Italy. Go straight from this picture to the
Rubens in the Salon Carré in order to observe the way in which
the theme has been treated, with considerable attention to
traditional detail, yet with highly transformed feeling, by the
great and princely Flemish painter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nativity, in Luini’s second fresco, is also full of traditional
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>
features,—a beautiful work in the peculiar spirit of this
gentle artist. Note every one of the accessories and details,
observing how they have come from earlier pictures, and also
how completely Luini has subordinated them to his own art
and his delicate handling. Comparison of these two with the
other Luinis in other rooms will give you some idea of his
varying manners in fresco and oil-painting. Note that the
frescoes represent him best, and are fullest of Luini.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Another picture, which in a wholly different direction exemplifies
the need for knowledge of works of art elsewhere, and
especially under the conditions in which they were originally
painted, is to be found in Carpaccio’s <span class='bold'>Preaching of St.
Stephen</span>, on the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> hand wall, shortly after you enter the Salle
des Primitifs. This is one of a series of the Life of St.
Stephen,—a form of composition of which the only good
example in the Louvre is Lesueur’s insipid and colourless set,
recounting the biography and miracles of St. Bruno. In Italy,
such histories of saints are everywhere common, as frescoes
or otherwise. Those who know Venice, for example, will
well remember Carpaccio’s own charming series of the Life
of St. Ursula, now well arranged round the walls of a single
room in the Venice Academy. Still better will they understand
the nature of these works if they have seen Carpaccio’s
other delicious series of the Life of St. George, in San Giorgio
dei Schiavoni, where the pictures still remain, at their original
height from the ground, and in their original position, on the
walls of the church for which they were painted. Only in
such situations can works of this kind be properly estimated.
That they can less easily be understood in isolation, you can
gather if you look at the four cabinet pictures from the boudoir
of Isabella d’Este, by Mantegna, Perugino, and Costa, which
hang not far from this very St. Stephen in the same room of
the Louvre. The size of the figures, in particular, is largely
dictated by the shape of the room, the distance from the
eye, and the character of the space which the painter has to
cover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This St. Stephen series, again, once existed entire as five
pictures, all by Carpaccio, in the Scuola (or Guild) of St.
<span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span>
Stephen at Venice. Similar sets of other saints still exist in
the Scuola di San Rocco and other Guilds in the city. The
first of the group, which represents the saint being consecrated
as deacon by St. Peter, is now in the Berlin Gallery. The
second, the Preaching of St. Stephen, is the one before
which you are now standing. The third, St. Stephen disputing
with the Doctors, is at the Brera in Milan. The fourth, the
Martyrdom of St. Stephen, is at Stuttgardt. The fifth and last,
St. Stephen Enthroned, between St. Nicolas and St. Thomas
Aquinas, has disappeared from sight, or at least its present
whereabouts is unknown to me. It is interesting to look out
for such companion works in widely separated galleries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rightly to understand this picture, once more, one should
know Carpaccio. And fully to know him one must have spent
some time in Venice. But even without that knowledge, it
is pleasant here to remark the familiar acquaintance with
oriental life, which is equally visible in the neighbouring
picture of the School of Bellini representing the reception
of a Venetian Ambassador at Cairo. The mixed character
of the architecture and the quaint accessories are all redolent
of Carpaccio’s semi-mediæval and picturesque sentiment. The
pellucid atmosphere, the apparent realism, the underlying
idealism, the naïveté of the innocent saint in his deacon’s
robes, counting his <span class='it'>firstly</span>, <span class='it'>secondly</span>, and <span class='it'>thirdly</span> on his fingers,
irrespective of persecution, and the glow and brilliancy of
the Venetian colouring, here approaching its zenith, all
combine to make this daintily simple picture one of the most
attractive in this part of the Louvre. Recollect it when you
go to Milan and Venice, and let it fall into its proper place,
in time, in your mature conception of the painter and the
epoch in which he lived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor is this all. It must be borne in mind that while the
Louvre is one of the noblest collections of pictures in Europe,
it differs from most other fine collections in the fact that
its most important and valuable works are <span class='bold'>not of native
origin</span>, nor of one race, school, or period. The pictures at
Florence are almost all Florentine: the pictures at Venice
are almost all Venetian. At Bruges and Antwerp we have
few but Flemish works: at the Hague and Amsterdam, few
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>
but Dutch. In the Louvre, on the contrary (as at Dresden
and Munich), we get several masterpieces of <span class='it'>all</span> the great
schools, with relatively few minor works of the groups to
which they belong, by whose light to understand them. In
short, this is a gallery of purple patches. The gems of the
collection are the Raphaels, the Titians, the Leonardos, an
exquisite Van Eyck, a splendid Memling, a few fine Murillos,
a number of great Rubenses. To understand all these, we
must know something of Florentine art, Umbrian art, Venetian
art, Flemish art, Spanish art, and so forth. The finest pictures
of any in the collection are not French at all, and cannot
wholly be comprehended by the light of works in this gallery
alone. Therefore it is best, if possible, <span class='bold'>to return to the
Louvre</span> after visiting every other great school of art in Europe.
On the other hand, a few great artists are here very amply
represented; among them I may particularise Raphael, Titian,
Mantegna, Leonardo and the Leonardesque school, Gerard
Dou, and Rembrandt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a further example of the light cast by pictures elsewhere
on those in this Gallery, however, I prefer to take a single little
subject from the predella of <span class='bold'>Fra Angelico’s</span> glorious <span class='bold'>Coronation
of the Virgin</span>: I mean the compartment which represents
St. Dominic and his brethren being fed by angels in the
monastery of St. Sabina at Rome. Anybody who looks at
Fra Angelico’s painting, even in these smaller works, can
recognise at once his tender, saintly, and devout manner. He
is permeated by a spirit of adoring reverence, which comes
out in every one of his angels and martyrs. Fewer people,
however, note that the angelic friar was also a loyal and devoted
<span class='bold'>Dominican</span>. Whatever he paints is to the glory of
God: but it is also to the glory of St. Dominic and of the
order that he founded. This beautiful altar-piece, for instance,
was produced by the Dominican painter of Fiesole for the
Dominican church of St. Dominic at Fiesole. The saint himself,
with his little red star, is everywhere apparent: and those
who have visited Fra Angelico’s own Dominican monastery
of San Marco at Florence will recollect that the founder and
his red star similarly occur in almost every fresco in that beautiful
building. They will also recollect that this very subject
<span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>
of the brethren fed by angels forms the theme for a beautiful
but much later fresco by Sogliani in the Great Refectory of the
same monastery. Such an episode is admirably adapted for
one of those large pictures representing a repast of some
sacred character which it was usual to place on the end wall
of conventual dining halls. Compare it also with a Spanish
treatment of a similar miracle by Murillo, in the Cuisine des
Anges. Note the simplicity and sobriety of the Early Italian
work, as contrasted with the strained feeling and insistence
upon mere effects of luminosity and glory in the showy Spanish
painting. The moral of all such half-allegorical miracles is
clearly this:—Our order is sustained by God’s divine providence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have said already that a <span class='bold'>German Last Supper</span> in this
collection (German Room) betrays the influence of Leonardo’s
great fresco on the wall of the monastery of Santa Maria
delle Grazie at Milan, of which an early copy by a pupil of
Leonardo’s exists in the Louvre (<span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> wall of the Long Gallery).
But in order thoroughly to understand Leonardo’s Last Supper,
again, we must similarly compare it with many previous representations
of the same sacred scene. The type, in fact, was
begun among nameless Byzantine and early Christian artists,
whose work can best be studied in Italy. It found its first
notable artistic expression in Giotto’s fresco at Santa Croce at
Florence, where the traditional type is considerably transformed:
and this Giottesque Last Supper was repeated over
and over again by many copyists, who each introduced various
modifications. Ghirlandajo once more transformed the type
at San Marco and the Ognissanti; and from Ghirlandajo,
Leonardo borrowed part of his arrangement, while transfusing
it with an entirely new element of life and action, at a dramatic
moment, which marks this great painter’s style, and is a distinct
move forward in the art of composition. Each work of art
down to the end of the 16th century can thus only be fully
understood by considering it in its proper place, as one of a
continuous evolutionary series. Every painter took much
from those who went before: his individuality can best be
gauged by observing how he transformed and modified what
he borrowed.
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Now take <span class='bold'>Ghirlandajo’s Visitation</span> in the Salle des
Primitifs as an example of a work which in quite a different
way, requires to be understood by light from elsewhere. Note
how admirably the figures here are balanced against the sky
and the archway in the background. In itself, this is a beautiful
and striking picture; but it is also a good illustration of
those subjects which cannot adequately be understood by consideration
of works in this Gallery alone. The attitudes and
costumes of the two principal personages are strictly conventional:
nay, if you compare the St. Elizabeth in this Visitation
with the same saint in the Mantegna almost opposite, you will
see that her dress and features remain fairly typical, even in
two such very distinct schools as the Paduan and the Florentine.
The relative positions of the Madonna and her elder
cousin have come down to Ghirlandajo from a very remote
antiquity: they were adopted, with modification, by Giotto, in
his fresco of this subject in the Madonna dell’ Arena at Padua.
But Giotto also introduced <span class='bold'>an arch</span> in the background, which
persists in almost all later representations. His arch, however,
is blind—you do not see the sky through it. So is Taddeo
Gaddi’s, in his closely similar Visitation at Santa Croce in
Florence: but the figures here still more nearly approach the
positions of the Ghirlandajo, and they stand more directly
framed, as it were, by the arch behind them. Skipping many
intermediate examples, each of which leads up to this picture,
we come to this beautiful embodiment of Ghirlandajo’s, which,
while retaining the simplicity of composition in the earlier
examples, shows a fine artistic instinct in the way in which the
chief characters are silhouetted in the gap of the archway.
Ghirlandajo accepted the older tradition, while transforming it
with the skill and taste of the early Renaissance after his own
fashion. Those who have visited Florence will remember how
Pacchiarotto, in his admirable presentation of the same subject,
now in the Belle Arti in that town—which, like this one, is a
Visitation with selected saints as spectators—has closely followed
Ghirlandajo’s treatment with still further modifications:
while the noble embodiment of the same scene by Mariotto
Albertinelli, in the Uffizi, consists of the two central figures in
the Ghirlandajo or the Pacchiarotto, cut out, as it were, and
<span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>
presented separately with noble effect against a background of
sky seen through the archway. In such a case we see distinctly
how the individual work can only fairly be judged as a
development of motives borrowed from others which have
preceded it, and how in turn it gives rise later to still further
modifications of its own conception. If you have not yet
visited Florence, bear in mind this work when you see the
Pacchiorotto and the Albertinelli. It is a good plan for the
purposes of such comparison to carry about photographs of
other pictures in the same series. You may go straight from
the Ghirlandajo here to the Sebastiano del Piombo in the
Salon Carré; and thence again to a copy of Pontormo’s Visitation
in the Long Gallery (<span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> side, near the Fra Bartolommeo),
which is interesting as showing a survival of the arch, treated
with far less effect, and thrown away as an element in the
composition. Here the attendant saints have become a confused
crowd, and the degradation of Fra Bartolommeo’s balanced
grouping is very conspicuous. Make one picture thus
cast light upon another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[The <span class='bold'>Sculpture</span> at the Louvre falls into three main divisions,
each of which is housed in a separate part of the building.
The <span class='bold'>Classical Sculpture</span> is approached by the same door
as the Paintings, and occupies the basement floor of Jean
Goujon’s part of the Old Louvre, with the wing beneath the
Galerie d’Apollon. The <span class='bold'>Renaissance Sculpture</span> is approached
by a separate door in the eastern half of the same
side, and occupies the corresponding suite opposite the Classical
series. The <span class='bold'>Modern Sculpture</span> is also approached by a
special door in the north wing of the <span style='font-size:smaller'>W</span> side in the old Cour
du Louvre, and occupies the suite beyond the Pavillon de
l’Horloge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The importance of these three divisions is very different.
Without doubt, the most valuable collection, intrinsically and
artistically speaking, is that of the <span class='bold'>Classical</span> or <span class='bold'>Antique
Sculpture</span>: and this should be visited in close detail by all
those who do not contemplate a trip to Rome, Naples, and
Florence. Nobody can afford to miss the “Venus of Milo,”
<span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>
the “Diana of Gabii,” or the Samothracian Nikè. On the
other hand, these exquisite Greek and Roman works, models
of plastic art for all time, including two or three of the greatest
masterpieces which have come down to us from antiquity, have
yet no <span class='it'>organic connection</span> with French history, or even, save
quite indirectly, with the development of French art. At the
same time, thoroughly to understand them is a work for the
specialist: those who have little or no classical knowledge, and
who desire to comprehend them, must be content to buy the
new official catalogue (not yet issued), to follow closely the
excellent labels, and also to study the subject in detail in the
various excellent handbooks of antique sculpture, such as
Lübke’s or Gardner’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The discrimination of the different schools, and the evidence
(usually very inferential) as to the affiliation of the various
works on the great masters or their followers, are so much
matters of expert opinion that I do not propose to enter into
them here. I shall merely give, for the general reader, a brief
account of the succession and evolution of antique plastic art,
as exemplified in the various halls of this gallery, referring him
for further and fuller details to specialist works on the subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Renaissance Sculpture</span>, on the other hand, is largely
French; and, whether French or Italian, it bears directly on
the evolution of Parisian art, and has the closest relations with
the life of the people. Every visitor to Paris should therefore
pay great attention to this important collection, which forms
the best transitional link in Western Europe between Gothic
Mediævalism and the modern spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The collection of <span class='bold'>Modern Sculpture</span>, again, is both artistically
and historically far less important. It may be visited in
an hour or two, and it is chiefly interesting as bridging the
lamentable gap between the fine Renaissance work of the age
of the later Valois, and the productions of contemporary
French sculptors.]</p>

</div>

<h4 id='ch3b-2-1'><span style='font-size:x-small'>I.</span> ANTIQUE SCULPTURE</h4>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>[Few or none of the most famous masterpieces of the great
classical artists have come down to us with absolute certainty.
The plastic works which we actually possess are for the most
<span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>
part those which have been casually preserved by accidental
circumstances. Almost all the greatest productions of the
greatest sculptors have either been destroyed or else defaced
beyond recognition. We therefore depend for our knowledge
of ancient sculpture either upon those works which were situated
on comparatively inaccessible portions of huge buildings
like the Parthenon and other temples, and which have consequently
survived more or less completely the ravages of time,
the mischief of the barbarian, and the blind fury of early Christian
and Mahommedan fanatics; or else upon those which have
been preserved for us in the earth, under the débris of burnt
and ruined villas and gardens, or in the ashes of buried cities
like Pompeii. Under these circumstances, the wonder is that
so much of beautiful and noble should still remain to us. This
is mainly owing to the fact that in antiquity <span class='bold'>a fine model</span>,
once produced, was repeated and varied <span class='it'>ad infinitum</span>,—much as
we have seen at Cluny and in the paintings upstairs each principal
scene from the Gospels or the legends of the saints, once
crystallized by custom, was reproduced over and over again
with slight alterations by many subsequent artists. The consequence
is that most of the statues in this department fall into
well-marked groups with other examples here or elsewhere.
We have not the originals, in most cases, but we have <span class='bold'>many
copies</span>; and few of these copies are servile reproductions:
more often, they show some touch of the individual sculptor.
The best antiques are therefore generally those which happen
most nearly to approach in spirit and execution a great and
famous original. (See later, for example, the Apollo Sauroctonus.)
You must compare these works one with another, in
this collection and elsewhere, in this spirit, recollecting that
often even an inferior variant represents in certain parts the feeling
of the original far better than another and generally finer
example may happen to do. Nay, such splendid works as the
so-called Venus of Milo itself must thus be regarded rather as
fortunate copies or modifications of an accepted type by some
gifted originator than as necessarily originals by the best masters.
With the exception of the few fragments from the Parthenon by
Pheidias and his pupils, hardly anything in this gallery can be
set down with certainty to any first-class name of the very best
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>
periods. But many statues can be assigned to groups which
took their origin from certain particular famous sculptors: we
know the <span class='it'>school</span>, though not the <span class='it'>artist</span>. And several are judged
by the descriptions of ancient writers to be copies or variants
of works assigned to sculptors of the first eminence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many of the statues found in the Renaissance period, and up
to the close of the eighteenth century, have been freely and
often injudiciously restored: others have really antique heads,
which do not however in every case belong to them. Not a
few have been considerably altered and hacked about in the
course of restoration, or of arbitrarily supplying them with
independent faces. This reprehensible practice has <span class='it'>not</span> been
followed in more recent additions such as the “Venus of Milo”
and the Samothracian Nikè.]</p>

</div>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Enter by the same door as for the paintings. Proceed along
the corridor (Galerie Denon) and dive, right or left, under the
great staircase. (Good new room to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, containing excellent
Roman mosaics from French North Africa.) Pass some
good sarcophagi and other objects, and enter the <span class='bold'>Rotonde</span>,
which contains for the most part works of a relatively late
period. In the centre, the <span class='bold'>*</span>Borghese Mars (or, in Greek, Ares),
a celebrated statue, less virile than is usual in figures of this
god. Round the room are grouped many fairly good statues,
not a few of them almost duplicates. Among them should be
noticed (beginning from the door) on the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> a fine Melpomène;
then, the Lycian Apollo, with harmless serpent gliding from a
tree-trunk; and especially the famous <span class='bold'>*</span>Silenus nursing the Infant
Bacchus, of the School of the great sculptor Praxiteles—perhaps
the most pleasing of the many representations of Faun
and Satyr life which antiquity has bequeathed to us. This
work should be studied as showing that later stage of easy Greek
culture when sculpture was not wholly religious and monumental,
but when the desire to please by direct arts and graces
was distinctly present. Close by are two or three good draped
female figures; and another Lycian Apollo, which should be
closely compared with the one opposite it, as indicating the
nature of the numerous copies or replicas commonly made of
famous works of antiquity. Beside this, a couple of Hermæ,
<span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span>
or heads on rough bases, in later imitation of the archaic
Greek style, with its curious stiff simper: the type was doubtless
too sacred to be varied from: a portrait-statue of a lady
with the attributes of Ceres; a charming Nymph, carrying an
amphora; excellent figures of athletes, etc. Many of the statues
in this and succeeding rooms are much restored, and in some
cases with heads that do not belong to them. They are interesting
as showing the general high level of plastic art among
nameless artists of the classical period.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next room, <span class='bold'>**</span>the <span class='bold'>Salle Grecque</span>, or <span class='bold'>Salle de Phidias</span>,
is interesting as containing a few works of the great artist after
whom it is called, as well as many specimens of <span class='bold'>archaic</span> Greek
art, before it had yet attained to the freedom and grace of the
age of Pheidias. In the <span class='bold'>centre</span> are fragments of the early half-prehistoric
figures (6th century <span style='font-size:smaller'>B.C.</span>) commonly known as
Apollos, but more probably serving in many cases merely as
funereal monuments—a man in the abstract, to represent the
deceased, like a headstone. They exhibit well the constrained
attitudes and want of freedom in the position of the arms and
legs, which are characteristic of the earliest epoch. These
very old features are still more markedly seen in the mutilated
draped Herè in the centre; it well illustrates the <span class='bold'>starting-point</span>
of Hellenic art. The admirable <span class='bold'>*</span>bas-reliefs from Thasos on
the entrance wall, on the other hand—removed from a votive
monument to Apollo, the Nymphs and the Graces, and still
retaining the dedicatory inscription graven over their portal,—exemplify
the gradual increase in freedom and power of modelling
during the early part of the 5th century <span style='font-size:smaller'>B.C.</span> This improvement
is very noticeable in the Hermes with one of the Graces on the
first of these reliefs. Still somewhat angular in movement, they
herald the approach of the Pheidian period. From this time
forward the advance becomes incredibly rapid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next, examine the work of the <span class='bold'>perfect period</span>. Above is a
mutilated fragment of Athenian girls ascending the Acropolis to
present the holy robe to Athenè, from the <span class='bold'>frieze of the Parthenon</span>,
of the great age of Pheidias (not a century later than these
archaic attempts): with portions of a Metope of the same
temple. The first may be possibly by Pheidias himself: the
second by his pupil Alcamenes. Close by, <span class='bold'>Metope of the</span>
<span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>
<span class='bold'>temple of Zeus at Olympia</span> (about 450 <span style='font-size:smaller'>B.C.</span>), whose subjects
are sufficiently indicated on the labels: almost equal in power
to the Athenian examples. The fine bas-relief of Orpheus and
Eurydice, of the best period (falsely named above, later) should
also be observed. (But the works of the archaic and transitional
periods are far better exemplified at Munich and in
London; while the fragments of Pheidias cannot of course compare
with the magnificent series in the British Museum. See
the copies of both in the École des Beaux Arts.) By the next
window, lion and bull, somewhat recalling remote Assyrian
influence; with numerous small reliefs of the best age, which
should be carefully studied. These, for the most part of the
finest early workmanship, admirably illustrate the extraordinary
outburst of artistic spirit during the age which succeeded the
wars with Persia. The reliefs on the <span class='bold'>end wall</span>, chiefly from
Athens and the Piræus, as well as those by the last window,
belong in most instances to this splendid age of awakening
and culminating art-faculty. I do not enumerate, as the labels
suffice; but every one of the works in this room should be
closely followed. Do not miss the charming, half-archaic,
funereal relief of Philis, daughter of Cleomedes, from Thasos.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Continue on through the Long Gallery, flanked by inferior
works—but what splendid inferiority!—to the room of the
<span class='bold'>Medea sarcophagus</span>, a fine stone tomb, containing scenes
from the legend of Medea and the children of Jason. Round
the room are grouped several small statues, much restored,
indeed, and not of the best period, but extremely charming.
The most noticeable is the dainty little group of the Three
Graces, characteristic and pleasing, though with modern heads.
The next compartment—that of the <span class='bold'>Hermaphrodite</span>—includes
one of the best and purest of the many versions of this favourite
subject, from Velletri, couched, by the window. (Another in the
Salle des Caryatides, for comparison.) The Farnese Eros is a
pretty work of a late period. The room also possesses several
works of the Satyr class, two of which, close by, are useful as
instances of repetition. The four statues of Venus (Aphroditè),
at the four corners (in two closely similar pairs) are also very
interesting in the same manner, being variants based upon one
original model, closely resembling one another in their general
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>
features, but much altered in the accessories and details. The
same may be said of the good figures of Athenè by the far
wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Hall of the <span class='bold'>Sarcophagus of Adonis</span> contains several
excellent sarcophagi, the reliefs on which well illustrate the
character of the class; among them, one to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> has interesting
reclining figures of its occupant and his wife, an early
motive, late repeated. The relief from which the room takes
its name, on the wall to the right, represents, in three scenes,
the departure of Adonis for the chase; his wounding by a wild
boar; and Aphroditè mourning over the body of her lover.
Such reliefs afforded important hints in mediæval times to the
sculptors who first started the Renaissance movement. As we
pass into the next compartment, notice another variant of the
Aphroditè.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Salle de Psyché</span> contains, opposite the window, the
famous figure from which it takes its name (too much restored
to be freely judged): together with two characteristic dancing
Satyrs, after models of the school of Praxiteles. The fine
sculptured chairs of office by the window should also be noticed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We now come to the Hall of the so-called <span class='bold'>Venus of Milo</span>—an
absurd mistranslation of the French name: the idiomatic
English would be either “the Melos Venus,” “the Melian
Venus,” or, better still, “the Melian Aphroditè.” This is undoubtedly
the finest plastic work in the whole of the Louvre.
Its beauty is self-evident. It was found in 1820 in the island of
Melos in the Greek Archipelago. The statue is usually held
to represent the Greek goddess of love, and is a very noble
work, yet <span class='it'>not</span> one by a recognised master, nor even mentioned
by ancient writers among the well-known statues of antiquity.
Nothing could better show the incredible wealth of Greek
plastic art, indeed, than the fact that this exquisite Aphroditè
was produced by a nameless sculptor, and seems to have been
far surpassed by many other works of its own period. In type,
it belongs to a school which forms a transition between the
perfect early grace and purity of Pheidias, with his pupils, and
the later, more self-conscious and deliberate style of Praxiteles
and his contemporaries. Not quite so pure as the former, it is
free from the obvious striving after effect in the latter, and
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>
from the slightly affected prettinesses well illustrated here in the
group of Silenus with the infant Bacchus. The famous series
of Niobe and her Children, in the Uffizi at Florence (duplicates
of some elsewhere), exhibits much the same set of characteristics.
Those works have been attributed on reasonable grounds
to Scopas, a contemporary of Demosthenes: and this statue has
therefore been ascribed with little hesitation to one of his pupils.
It is, however, purer in form than the Niobe series, and exhibits
the perfect ideal, artistic and anatomical, of the beautiful, healthy
nude female form for the white race. Its proportions are famous.
As regards the missing portions, which have happily <span class='it'>not</span> been
conjecturally restored, it was originally believed that the left
hand held an apple (the symbol of Melos), while the right
supported the drapery. It is more probable, however, that the
figure was really a Nikè (or Victory) and that she grasped a
shield and possibly also a winged figure on an orb. Comparison
with the other similar half-draped nude statues described as
Venuses in the adjoining rooms is very instructive: their
resemblances and differences show the nature of the modifications
from previous types, while the immense superiority of this
to all the rest is immediately apparent. Notice in particular
the exquisite texture of the skin; the perfect moderation of the
form, which is well developed and amply covered, without the
faintest tinge of voluptuous excess, such as one gets in late
work; and the intellectual and moral nobility of the features.
No object in the Louvre deserves longer study. It is one of the
finest classical works that survive in Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pass to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> into the next suite of rooms, the first of which
contains the colossal figure of <span class='bold'>Melpomène</span>, the tragic muse—a
splendid example of this imposing type of antique sculpture,
so well represented in the Vatican. Round the room are ranged
several minor works, including a charming Flute-Player, doubtfully
restored, and some excellent busts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The long series of rooms which follows this one contains
in many cases Græco-Roman works, imitated from the great
Greek models, and often showing more or less decadent spirit.
Among them, however, are some of the finest specimens of
ancient sculpture, Greek included: and indeed it must be
admitted that the grounds upon which such Greek works are
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>
distinguished by experts from later copies are often sufficiently
delicate and inferential. Centre, a beautiful Genius of Sleep.
Behind it, good figures of Eros (Love) drawing his bow, again
indicating the nature of the replicas and variations of established
models which were so familiar to antique sculptors. The
little mutilated fragment by their side, well placed here for
comparison, excellently illustrates the nature of the evidence
on which such works are frequently restored. Further on—a
Venus, which is a variant (probably Roman) of the type of the
Venus of Arles, just beyond it. Behind this, a little in front
in the room, the noble <span class='bold'>*</span>Pallas from Velletri—the finest and
most typical representation of the goddess: a good Roman
copy of a Greek work of the best period. Then the famous
<span class='bold'>*</span>Venus of Arles itself, a Greek original, which may be instructively
compared with the replica or variant close to it.
(The labels well indicate to the student who cares to proceed
further in this study the extent of the restorations in every
case.) This figure, after the Melian Aphroditè, is probably the
most beautiful female form in the entire collection. Behind
it, the graceful and exquisitely-draped Polyhymnia (replica of
a well-known type), a model of perfect repose and culture, but
largely modern. Then, good bust of Homer. Next, the <span class='bold'>*</span>Apollo
Sauroctonus or Lizard-Slayer, a copy in marble of a famous
work in bronze by Praxiteles. This is once more one of the
many reproductions (not necessarily always actual copies) of
types which are mentioned by classical authors. By the archway,
Euterpe, and a Votary. Among the sarcophagi, one of
Actæon torn by his dogs: another representing the Nine
Muses. Most of the figures in this room are marked by a calm
and classical repose; while those in the next compartment,</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Salle du Héros Combatant</span>, indicate in many cases
a later tendency to rapidity of motion and violent action, which
is alien to the highest plastic ideal. Among the most successful
works of this group is the light and airy Atalanta, under the
archway,—a beautiful figure of a young girl, running, caught
at the most exquisite statuesque moment. Near it, a fine Venus
Genetrix. By the window, admirable figure of a wounded
Amazon. Next window, the celebrated Borghese Centaur and
Bacchus, a charming realization of this mythological conception.
<span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>
Note the playfulness of developed Greek fancy. The
centre of the room is occupied by a powerful and anatomically
admirable figure of a Fighting Hero (formerly called a Gladiator),
by Agasias of Ephesus,—one of the few statues here on
which the sculptor has inscribed his name. It is a triumph
of its own “active” type of art (where movement and life are
aimed at), but wholly lacking in beauty or ideality. It belongs
to the age of Augustus or a little earlier. Behind it, Marsyas
flayed alive, a repetition of a frequent but unpleasant subject.
Centre again, the Faun of Vienne, a young satyr, retaining
traces of colour, vigorous and clever. Then, <span class='bold'>**</span>exquisite ideal
statue of a young girl fastening her cloak, commonly but incorrectly
known as the Diana of Gabii; for simple domestic grace
this dainty work is unrivalled. It is probably of the age of
Alexander the Great: and is well worth study. It almost
suggests the Italian Renaissance. By the archways, a Hermes
known as the Richelieu Mercury, with a closely similar replica.
Under the archway leading to the next room, fine portrait
statue of the age of Hadrian, representing Antinous, the Emperor’s
favourite, in the guise of Aristæus, the mythical hero
of agriculture: the features are much less beautiful than in
most other instances of this well-known face, several examples
of which occur later. Such representations of historical characters
in the form of gods or mythical heroes were common
at Rome: probably in most cases the sitter’s head and figure
were accommodated or adapted to a well-known model.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Salle du Tibre</span>, which we next enter, contains in its
centre the celebrated figure of <span class='bold'>*</span>Artemis (Diana) known as
“Diane à la Biche” or the “Diane de Versailles,” one of the
antique statues acquired by François I<sup>er</sup>, the influence of which
on later art will be very distinctly felt when we come to examine
the French sculpture of the Renaissance. It is a charming,
graceful, and delicate figure of the age of declining art, exactly
adapted to take the French fancy of that awakening period.
It was probably executed at Rome by a Greek sculptor about
the time of Julius Cæsar. At the end of the room, colossal
recumbent figure of the Tiber, represented as the benignant
Father Tiber of Rome, bearing the oar which symbolizes the
navigable river, and the cornucopia denoting the agricultural
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>
and commercial wealth of the Tiber valley: by its side nestles
the wolf, with Romulus and Remus; a pretty allegorical conception
of Rome and the stream which made it: itself doubtless
a pendant to the similar recumbent figure of the Nile in
the Vatican. Close by, two Satyrs, imitated from Praxiteles.
Behind, four Satyrs as Caryatides, from the theatre of Dionysus,
Athens, 3rd cent. <span style='font-size:smaller'>B.C.</span> Round the wall, good draped figures
of goddesses. Walk through these rooms often, in order to
gain an idea of the astonishing wealth and purity of Hellenic
sculpture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, return through the Salle Grecque and the Rotonde,
and turn to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> into the <span class='bold'>Roman Galleries</span>, which contain
for the most part statues and busts of the imperial epoch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the first room are reliefs of sacrifices, and fronts of sarcophagi,
together with a fine portrait-statue of Sulla. By the
second window, the famous and noble head of Mæcenas, the
great Etruscan statesman and minister of Augustus, who practically
organised the Roman Empire. The astute features,
very Tuscan in type, which in some degree recall those both
of Bismarck and Möltke, are full of practical vigour and the
wisdom of statecraft. A more characteristic or finer head has
not been bequeathed to us by antiquity. Contrast this magnificent
and thoughtful bust of the best Roman age, instinct
with meaning, with the coarse and coarsely-executed colossal
head of Caracalla, the cruel and sensuous Emperor of the
decadence, in the next window,—as crude as a coarse lithograph.
In the corner, a Mithra stabbing a bull, of a class to
be noted again in greater detail later. By the passage into the
next room, masks of Medusa with the snaky hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Walk straight through the following rooms, without stopping,
till you arrive at the <span class='bold'>Salle d’Auguste</span> on the right, at the end,
so as to take the works in historical sequence. This hall is the
first in chronological order of the <span class='bold'>Roman period</span>. It contains
portrait-statues and busts of the Julian Emperors and their
families, and of the Flavian dynasty. Begin down the centre.
<span class='bold'>*</span>Bust of Julius Cæsar, indicating well the intellectual character
and relentless will of the man: a speaking likeness. Next to
it, the famous <span class='bold'>**</span>Antinous (eyes removed; once jewels), a much
idealised colossal portrait-bust of the beautiful young favourite
<span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>
of the Emperor Hadrian, who drowned himself in the Nile in
order to become a protecting genius for his patron; he is here
represented in a grave and rigid style somewhat faintly reminiscent
of Egyptian art, and with the attributes of Bacchus or
(more correctly) Osiris; Hadrian deified him and erected a
temple in his honour in a town in Egypt which he named after
him. Observe the lotus entwined in the hair. Fine portrait-statue
of a Roman orator, probably Julius Cæsar, one of the
best works of its class of the best period of revived Greek art
under the early Roman Empire: signed by Cleomenes. The
figure is that conventionally attributed to Hermes or Mercury.
Near it, Agrippa, the son-in-law of Augustus and builder of the
Panthéon; full of the statesmanlike characteristics of the early
empire. Ideal bust of Rome, cold but beautiful; Romulus and
Remus on the helmet. Under the tribune, famous <span class='bold'>*</span>portrait-statue
of Augustus, a very noble representation. It is flanked
by two good portrait-statues of the Emperor himself, and of
his successor, Tiberius. In front of it are Roman boys of the
imperial family, the one to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> admirable in execution.
They wear the golden bulla round their necks, which marked
lads of noble family; the faces and figures are thoroughly
patrician. Windowless wall, members of the imperial (Julian
and Claudian) family,—Agrippina, Tiberius, Drusus and Germanicus,
etc.; Caligula, showing incipient traces of Cæsarian
madness; Octavia, Antonia, and others. Study these carefully.
Then, a most malignant Nero, with less unpleasant ones
further: a Messalina, whose gentleness of face belies her
reputation; a grandiose Claudius; and a selfish Galba, in
whom we begin to see traces of the traits produced by ruthless
struggle for empire. Near him, a vain-glorious Otho, still fine
and classical. Notice the dainty profiles of the women. All
the statues and busts in this room, indeed, are conceived in the
fine classical spirit, with no trace of the coming decadence.
Most of them have the old close-shaven, clear-cut Roman
features, contrasting strongly with the weaker, bearded types
we shall see later. By the window wall, statues, not so good,
of the coarse bull-necked Vitellius; hard, practical, business-like
Vespasian; capable Titus, and one or two less satisfactory
busts or statues of Julius Cæsar. Observe even already how
<span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span>
both types and art begin to show less perfect finish. The men
are more vulgar: the artists less able.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Salle des Antonins</span>, next, contains a fine series of busts
and statues of this second prosperous epoch of the empire.
Facing the river, a very noble seated portrait-statue of Trajan,
contrasting well with the other more decadent emperors at the
further end. We have here still the old Roman severity, and
the close-shaven type, admirably opposed to the more sensuous
degenerate faces further on, which herald the decadence.
These are the builders-up, the others the destroyers, of a great
empire. In the corner close by, two erect Trajans. Notice
how clear an idea of the personalities of the emperors
comparison of these statues and busts affords one. Close to
the archway, a beautiful Faustina Junior, one of the loveliest
portrait-busts of the second Roman period. Further on,
bearded and weaker emperors of the Antonine age; among
them, a capital Lucius Verus, holding the orb of empire.
Near it, a fine statue of the philosophic emperor, Marcus
Aurelius, seen here rather as the soldier than as the sage.
In the centre—the same emperor nude—or rather, a nude
figure, on which his head has been placed by a modern
restorer. By the middle window, colossal busts of Lucius
Verus and Marcus Aurelius, and a very big head of Lucilla,
wife of the former. These all deserve study, by comparison
with the simpler and nobler types of the Julian period.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Salle de Sevère</span>—age of the early decadence—contains
in the centre a fine statue of the Emperor’s mother, Julia
Mammæa, figured after the common fashion as Ceres—a half
deification. Near it, another (less pleasing) bust of Antinous.
Excellent statue of Pertinax. Round the walls, portrait-busts
of the Antonine family and their successors, in sufficient
numbers to enable one to form clear conceptions of their
personality. This is especially the case with Caracalla and
Plautilla by the last window; Septimius Severus himself—a
weak face, gaining somewhat with age; and Lucius Verus,
selfishly vicious, with a distinct tinge of conscious cruelty.
Near the last, a fine portrait-statue of Faustina Senior.
Beside it, pleasing bust of the boy Commodus; his subsequent
development may be traced round the rest of the
<span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>
window. All these busts, again, should be viewed by the light
of their dates; they are identified by means of coins, where
the same faces occur with their names—most interesting for
comparison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Salle de la Paix</span> contains mixed works, some of
them of the extreme decadence. Among them, a good figure
of Minerva in red porphyry, the flesh portions of which
have been restored in gilt bronze as Rome. By the window,
the Emperor Titus as Mars. A half-length of Gordianus Pius
near the archway is an unusually fine and classical example
for its age. Fine figure of Tranquillina, his wife, and nude
of Pupianus, less successful. In many of these works the
decadence triumphs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Salle des Saisons</span> contains busts, mostly of the
extreme <span class='bold'>decadence</span>, and works with a <span class='bold'>semi-barbaric</span> tinge.
The bust of Honorius, by the far door, shows the last traces
of classical work rapidly passing into <span class='bold'>Byzantine</span> stiffness and
lifelessness. Note the feebleness of the eyes and general
ineffectiveness of plastic treatment. Eugenius, opposite him,
equally displays decadence in a somewhat different direction,
provincial and Gaulish, foreshadowing barbaric Romanesque
workmanship. A fine Muse, however, stands next to Honorius.
There are also several very decent reliefs from sarcophagi.
The figure of Tiridates, wearing the barbaric trousers, is a fine
example of Greco-Roman art applied to a member of an alien
civilisation. Close to it, the famous <span class='bold'>Mithra</span> of the Capitol,
stabbing a bull, with other representations of the same
subject beneath and beside it. These reliefs are extremely
illustrative of a most interesting phase of the later Empire.
Rome was then a cosmopolitan city, crowded with Syrians,
Jews, Egyptians, Asiatic Greeks, and other Orientals. Many
of these people introduced into Italy and the Provinces the
worship of their own local deities: the cult of Isis, of
Serapis, and of other Eastern gods competed with Christianity
for the mastery of the Empire. Among these intrusive
religions, one of the most successful was the worship of
Mithra, which came to Rome indirectly from Persia, and
directly from the southern shores of the Black Sea. The
mystic deity himself is always represented in an underground
<span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span>
cave, stabbing a bull; he was regarded as a personification or
avatar of the Sun God. His worship spread rapidly to every
part of the Roman world, and was immensely popular:
similar reliefs have been found in all Romanized regions from
Britain to North Africa. The best of those in this room comes
from the cave of Mithra in the Capitol at Rome itself, where
the eastern god was permitted even to invade the precincts of
the Capitoline Jupiter. Notice the barbaric Oriental dress and
the voluptuous, soft Oriental treatment; also, the action in
the cave, and the personages on the upper earth above it.
Compare all these reliefs with one another, and notice their
origin as given on the labels. Observe also the close similarity
and religious fixity of the representations. They should be
studied with care, as illustrative of the conflict of new religions
with old in the Roman Empire, out of which Christianity at
last emerged triumphant. Their number and costliness shows
the strength of this strange faith; their inferior art betokens
both eastern influence and the approach of the decadence.
Compare the Oriental tinge in the Mithra reliefs with that of
some Early Christian works in the small Christian room of the
Renaissance Sculpture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the centre, Roman husband and wife, in the characters of
Mars and Venus, an excellent and characteristic group of the
age of Hadrian; contrast the somewhat debased proportions
with those we have seen in the best Greek period. Round the
wall and by the windows, many inferior portrait-busts of
emperors of the decadence; observe their dates, and note the
gradual decrease in art and truth, and the slow return to
something resembling archaic stiffness. We have thus followed
out the rise and culmination of antique art, and watched
its return to primitive barbarity. Conspicuous among the
works of the better age here are the charming features of
Julia Mammæa, wife of Alexander Severus, especially as
shown in the bust nearest to the first window. The fine
Germanicus, holding the orb of empire, is also an excellent
example of the portrait nude of the best period.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leave this portion of the Museum by the <span class='bold'>Salle des
Caryatides</span> beyond, so called from the famous Caryatides
by Jean Goujon (French Renaissance; see later), which
<span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>
support the balcony at its further end—very noble examples of
the revived antique of the age of François I<sup>er</sup>—majestic in
their serenity. Above them is a cast from Cellini’s Nymph
of Fontainebleau, to be noticed later. The room contains
good Greek and Roman work of the culminating periods.
In the <span class='bold'>vestibule</span> to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, by the window, the <span class='bold'>*</span>Borghese
Hermaphrodite, a variant on the Velletri type, voluptuous and
rounded, belonging to the latest Greek period; the mattress
was added (with disastrous effect) by Bernini. In the <span class='bold'>body
of the hall</span> colossal Jupiter of Versailles, an impressive
Hermes-figure. To the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, noble and characteristic <span class='bold'>*</span>Demosthenes.
In the centre, Hermes and Apollo of the School of
Praxiteles: boy fastening his sandals. Dionysus, known as
the Richelieu Bacchus. By the right wall, Aphroditè at the
bath, in a crouching attitude; a nymph is supposed to be
pouring water over her. All the works in this room deserve
examination; they are sufficiently described, however, by the
labels.</p>

<h4 id='ch3b-2-2'><span style='font-size:x-small'>2.</span> RENAISSANCE SCULPTURE.</h4>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>[This collection, one of the most important and interesting
among the treasures of the Louvre, occupies a somewhat unobtrusive
suite of rooms on the Ground Floor, and is therefore
too little visited by most passing tourists. It contains three
separate sets of plastic work: first, sculpture of the <span class='bold'>Italian
Renaissance</span>, on which the French was mainly based; second,
sculpture of the <span class='bold'>Middle Ages</span> in France, leading gradually up
to the age of François I<sup>er</sup>, and improving as it goes, though
uninfluenced as yet by external models; third, and most important
of all, in Paris at least, the exquisite sculpture of the
<span class='bold'>French Renaissance</span>, a revolt from mediævalism, inspired
from above by kings and nobles, based partly on direct study
of the antique (many specimens of which were brought to
France by François I<sup>er</sup>), but still more largely on Italian
models, made familiar to French students through the work of
artists invited to the Court under the later Valois, as well as
through the Italian wars of Charles VIII, Louis XII and
François I<sup>er</sup> (of which last more must be said when we visit St.
Denis). At least <span class='bold'>one whole day</span> should be devoted by every
one to this fascinating collection: those who can afford the
<span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>
time should come here often, and study <span class='it'>au fond</span> the exquisite
works of Donatello, Michael Angelo, and (most of all) Jean
Goujon, Germain Pilon, and their great French contemporaries.
The Italians can be seen to greater advantage at
Florence and elsewhere; only here can one form a just idea of
the beauty and importance of the French Renaissance.]</p>

</div>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Enter by Door D, in Baedeker’s plan—centre of the South-Eastern
wing in the (old) Cour du Louvre. Pass straight
through the vestibule, and Salle de Jean Goujon; then turn to
your <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, traversing the Salle de Michel Ange, and enter that
of the <span class='bold'>Italian Renaissance</span> (numbered VI officially).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Renaissance in France being entirely based upon that
in Italy, we have first to observe (especially in the case of those
who have not already visited Venice and Florence) what was
the character of the <span class='bold'>Italian works</span> upon which the French
sculptors and architects based themselves. Here you get, as it
were, the original: in French sculpture, the copy. This small
hall—the hall of <span class='bold'>Donatello</span>—contains works of sculpture of
the 13th to the 15th centuries in Italy. Contrast it mentally
with the purely mediæval objects which you saw at Cluny,
unrelieved for the most part by classical example, in order
to measure the distance which separates the Italians of this
epoch from their contemporaries north of the Alps. Recollect,
too, that the Italian Renaissance grew of itself from within,
while the French was an artificially cultivated exotic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>R and <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> of the door, early squat figures of Strength and
Prudence, Italian sculpture of the 13th century, still exhibiting
many Gothic characteristics, but with a nascent striving after
higher truth which began with the school of the Pisani at Pisa.
Opposite them, Justice and Temperance, completing the set of
the four cardinal virtues. These may be looked upon as the
point of departure. They show the first germ of Renaissance
feeling. L of doorway, good Madonna from Ravenna; flanked
by two innocent-faced angels, in deacon’s dress, drawing aside
a curtain from a tomb—beautiful work of the Pisan school of
the 14th century: contrasted with the best French reliefs at
Cluny (such as the legend of St. Eustace), these works exhibit
the early advance of art in Italy. Between them (contrasting
<span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>
well with the early French style, as much more idealised)
terra-cotta painted Madonna and Child. Beneath, good
Madonna in wood, and painted gesso Madonnas, later.
Near the window, <span class='bold'>**</span>beautiful bust of a child, by Donatello,
exhibiting the exquisite unconscious naïveté of the early
Renaissance. Most of these works are so fully described on
their pedestals that I shall only call attention to a few characteristics.
The emaciated figure of the Magdalen, in a Glory
of Cherubs, below, is the conventional representation of that
Saint, when a penitent in Provence, being daily raised aloft to
the beatific vision: many examples occur at Florence. The
beautiful little terra-cotta Madonna under a canopy close by is
admirable in feeling. Opposite it, characteristic decorative
work of the Renaissance. Then, <span class='bold'>**</span>Donatello’s naïf Young St.
John, the Patron Saint of Florence, is another exquisite example
of this beautiful sculptor. The open mouth is typical.
A Lucretia, near it, indicates the general tendency to imitate
the antique, still more marked in the relief of a funeral ceremony,
where the boy to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> is especially pleasing. Do not
overlook a single one of the Madonnas in this delightful room:
the one above the funeral relief, though skied, is particularly
pleasing. Even the large painted wooden Sienese Madonna
in the centre, though the merest church furniture, has the
redeeming touch of Italian idealism. The busts of Roman
emperors, imitated after the antique, betray on the other hand
the true spring of Renaissance impulse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room beyond—to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>—No. VII—is filled for the
most part with fine coloured terra-cottas or <span class='bold'>majolicas</span> of the
<span class='bold'>School of Della Robbia</span>. Centre of <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> wall, at the end (as you
enter), Madonna and Child, with St. Roch showing his plague
spot, and St. Francis pointing to the stigma in his side—a
votive offering. Fine nude figure, <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> of it, of Friendship, by
Olivieri. Exquisite little cherubs and angels. Bronze busts,
instinct with Renaissance feeling. Window wall—centre—a
Della Robbia of the Agony in the Garden: the arrangement is
conventional, and occurs in many other works in this Gallery.
It is flanked by two good Apostles of the Pisan school (the
first to imitate the antique) from the Cathedral of Florence.
Far <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, a voluptuous figure of Nature by Tribolo, from Fontainebleau,
<span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span>
characteristic of the works collected by François I<sup>er</sup>. R
wall, several Madonnas, all of which should be closely studied.
In the centre, terra-cotta of the School of Donatello. R and <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>
of it, fine busts of the Italian Renaissance, with most typical
faces. Near the door, portrait-statue of Louis XII, by Lorenzo
da Mugiano: this king was the precursor of the French
Renaissance: note the fine decorative work on his greaves and
knee-caps. In the centre, a fine St. Christopher, his face
distorted by the weight of the (non-existent) Christ Child. I
note these in particular, but <span class='it'>all</span> the works in these two rooms
should be closely followed, both as exhibiting the development
from traditional forms, and as illustrating the style of art on
which the French Renaissance was grafted. Notice for instance
(as survival, modified) the quaint little St. Catherine, in
the corner by the window, bearing her wheel, and laying her
hand with a caressing gesture on the donor—a special votary,
evidently. Observe, again, the three little scenes from the
life of St. Anne, in gilt wood, under the large Della Robbia of
the Ascension, on the wall opposite the windows. They represent
respectively the Rejection of Joachim’s Offering (he is
expelled from the Temple by the High Priest, because he is
childless: notice his servant carrying the lamb for sacrifice);
the Birth of the Virgin (with the usual details of St. Anne in
bed washing her hands, the bath for the infant, and the attendant
bringing in a roast chicken to the mother); and the Meeting
of Joachim and Anne at the Golden Gate—a scene which you
may often recognise elsewhere (it comes immediately after
the first, the Birth being interposed as principal subject: the
servant here bears the rejected lamb less ceremonially). Beneath
them, once more, a characteristically dainty St. George
and the Dragon—with the beautiful Princess most heartlessly
fleeing (as always) in the distance—should be carefully noted
for comparison later with Michel Colombe and Raphael (St.
George’s lance is accidentally broken: you can still see the
stump of it). To the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, again, is a beautiful Tabernacle of the
Della Robbia school—angels guarding relics. To the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, a
terra-cotta angel, most graceful and beautiful. Further <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>,
charming Madonna: I need hardly call attention to the frames
of fruit, which were a Della Robbia speciality. Further <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>,
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>
Baptism of Clovis, gilt, and very spirited, though over-crowded.
Do not overlook the skied St. Sebastian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(The little room beyond again contains a small but interesting
collection of <span class='bold'>Early Christian works</span> which must be visited
and studied on some other occasion. These very ancient
Christian sculptures, antique in conception, antedate the rise of
the conventional representations.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now return through Room VI to the <span class='bold'>Salle de Michel
Ange</span> (Room V), containing for the most part still more
developed works of the Italian Renaissance, which therefore
stand more directly in connection with French sculpture of that
and the succeeding period. The <span class='bold'>*doorway</span> by which we enter
is a splendid specimen of a decorated Italian Renaissance
portal, removed from the Palazzo Stanga at Cremona; it was
executed by the brothers Rodari at the end of the 15th century,
and is decorated with medallions of Roman Emperors, a figure
of Hercules (the mythical founder of Cremona), and of Perseus,
together with reliefs from the myths of those heroes and others.
Identify these. Above the name of Perseus, for example (to
the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>), is a relief representing the three Gorgons and the head
of Pegasus. Above that of Hercules (<span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>) are the heads of the
Hydra which he slew (as also represented in a bronze on the
end wall not far from it). This gateway you should mentally
compare, when you visit the École des Beaux-Arts, with that of
Diane de Poitiers’ Château d’Anet now erected in the courtyard
and with the <span class='it'>façade</span> of the Château de Gaillon at the same
place. The beautiful Italian Renaissance fountain in the
centre of the room comes itself from the same Château de
Gaillon: it was given to Cardinal d’Amboise (who built the
Château) by the Republic of Venice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The most beautiful works in this room, however, are the two
so-called <span class='bold'>*Fettered Slaves</span>, by Michael Angelo—in reality
figures of the Virtues, designed for the monument of Julius II.
It was Michael Angelo’s fate seldom to finish anything he
began. This splendid monument, interrupted by the too early
death of the Pope who commissioned it, was to have embraced
(among other features) figures of the Virtues, doomed to extinction
by the death of the pontiff. These are two of them:
the one to the right, unfinished, is of less interest: <span class='bold'>**</span>that to
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>
the left, completed, is of the exquisite beauty which this sculptor
often gave to nude youthful male figures. They represent the
culminating point of the Italian Renaissance, and should be
compared with the equally lovely sculptures of the Medici
tombs in San Lorenzo at Florence. Observe them well as
typical examples of Michael Angelo’s gigantic power and
mastery over marble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You will note in the windows close by several exquisite
<span class='bold'>bronze reliefs</span>; eight of them, by Riccio, are from the monument
of the famous anatomist, Della Torre, representing his
life and death in very classical detail. (<span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> window) Della Torre
lecturing at Verona; dangerously ill; sacrifice to the gods for
his recovery; his death and mourning: (<span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> window) his obsequies;
passage of the soul (as a naked child with a book) in
Charon’s boat (pursued by Furies); apotheosis (crowned by
Fame); and celebrity of the deceased on earth; all designed in
a thoroughly antique manner. (Souls of the recently dead are
frequently represented leaving the body like new-born children.)
This work shows the Renaissance not only as secular and
humanist but even as pagan: early ages would have considered
such treatment impious. All the other reliefs in this very important
room should be carefully noted. By this (<span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>) window,
the Annunciation (from Cremona); Judgment of Solomon (now
wholly conceived in the classical spirit); Adoration of the Magi,
in bronze; figures of Galba and Faustina, entirely antique in
tone; Paul shaking off the snake, etc. A portrait medallion of
Ludovico il Moro of Milan (also by this window) may be instructively
compared with those in contemporary Italian paintings
upstairs. The next (<span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>) window (with a rosso antico and
marble imitation of the Wolf of the Capitol) contains the beginning
of the reliefs from the tomb of Della Torre, in the same
classical style, together with two exquisite Madonnas by <span class='bold'>Mino
da Fiesole</span>, and other charming works of the same period.
The infantile simplicity of Mino has an unspeakable attraction.
Between the windows, a Pietà from Vicenza, with St. Jerome,
beating his breast as always with a stone, and St. Augustine
(I think) writing. On the far wall, note a fine wooden Annunciation
in two figures, from Pisa, of the Florentine 14th cent.
The angel Gabriel and the Madonna are frequently thus separated.
<span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>
Between them, admirable equestrian figure of Robert
Malatesta, of Rimini, where the action of the horse is particularly
spirited. Fine bust of Filippo Strozzi by Benedetto da Majano
on a pedestal close by. (You will find many works by this artist
for this patron at Florence.) The various Virgins on the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> wall
should also be carefully studied, as well as the fine wooden Circumcision—a
good rendering of the traditional scene, where the
artist triumphs over his intractable material—and the exquisitely
dainty bust of the Florentine <span class='bold'>**</span>Baptist, instinct with the
tender simplicity of Mino da Fiesole, whose decorative fragments
above must not be overlooked. Do not leave this room
without having carefully examined everything it contains, as
every object is deserving of study. [For instance, I have omitted
to mention works so fine as the self-explanatory High Renaissance
Jason, the relief of Julius Cæsar, the splendid bust of
Beatrice d’Este (see for this family the Perugino, etc., upstairs),
and the spirited bronze of Michael Angelo, lined with the lines
of a thinker who has struggled and suffered.] Finally, sit long
on the bench between the windows, and look well at the
<span class='bold'>Nymph of Fontainebleau</span>, with stag and wild boar, by Benvenuto
Cellini, the great Florentine metal-worker whom François
I<sup>er</sup> commissioned to produce this work for Fontainebleau.
(But Henri II gave it instead to Diane de Poitiers, for her
Château d’Anet.) Cellini’s work gave an immense impetus
to French sculpture, and it is largely on his style that Jean
Goujon and the great French sculptors we have shortly to examine
formed their conceptions. Voluptuous and overlithe,
this fine relief is a splendid example of its able, unscrupulous,
deft-handed artist—seldom powerful or deep, yet always exquisite
in tone and perfect in handicraft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, in order to form a just conception of the rise of the
<span class='bold'>French school of sculpture</span>, traverse the Salle de Jean Goujon
and the other rooms which succeed it, till you come to the last
room of the suite—officially No. I—the <span class='bold'>Salle d’André Beauneveu</span>.
This vault-like hall contains works of the <span class='bold'>Early French
School</span> of the 13th, 14th, and 15th cent., still for the most part
purely Gothic, and uninfluenced in any way by Italian models.
Among them we notice, at the far end of the room, near the
door which leads into the Egyptian Museum, several statuettes
<span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>
of Our Lady and Child, of a character with which Cluny has
already made us acquainted. Invariably crowned and noble,
they represent the Madonna as the Queen of Heaven, not the
peasant of Bethlehem. This regal conception and, still more,
the faint simper, are intensely French, and mark them off at
once from most Italian Madonnas. Further on, by the end
window, the figures of angels, of St. John Baptist, and of a
nameless king, are also thoroughly French in character; while
the dainty little Burgundian choir of angels, holding, as they
sing, a scroll with a Gloria, is in type half German. Note also
the numerous <span class='bold'>recumbent effigies from tombs</span>, among the
best of which are those of Catherine d’Alençon and of Anne of
Burgundy, Duchess of Bedford. The tombs at this end have
still the stiff formality of the early Gothic period. The strange
recumbent figure in the centre, supported by most funereal
mourners (placed too low to be seen properly), is the tomb of
Philippe Pot, Grand Seneschal of Burgundy under John the
Good, from the Abbey of Citeaux. Such mourners are characteristic
of the monumental art of Burgundy. One more occurs
under a canopy near the middle window: you will recollect to
have seen others (from the tomb of Philippe le Hardi) at Cluny.
Further on in the room we get more Madonnas whose marked
French type you will now be able to recognise. Good recumbent
figures of a bishop, and of Philip VI, sufficiently described
by the labels, and other excellent statues, one of the best of
which is the child in the centre. The king and queen by the
doorway are also fine examples of the art of the 15th cent.
Notice the dates of all these figures, as given by the labels, and
convince yourself from them (as you can do still more fully in
the next room) that French art itself made a <span class='bold'>domestic advance</span>
from the 11th cent., onward, wholly independent of Italian
influence. This advance was due in the main to national
development, and to the slow recovery of trade and handicraft
from the barbarian irruption. What was peculiar to Italy was
the large survival of antique works, which the School of Pisa,
and others after them, strove to imitate. In France, till François
I<sup>er</sup>, no such classical influence intervenes: the development
is all home-made and organic. But if you contrast the
busts by the <span style='font-size:smaller'>W</span> doorway, or the tombstone of Pierre de Fayet,
<span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>
near them, with the ruder work by the first window in the next
room, the reality of this advance will become at once apparent
to you. The artists, though still hampered by tradition, are
striving to attain higher perfection and greater truth to nature.
Do not miss in this connection the excellent wooden Flagellation
by the middle window: nor the Madonna opposite it; nor the
donor and donatrix close by; nor the fine mutilated Annunciation
(with lily between the figures) by the <span style='font-size:smaller'>W</span> window; nor the
well-carved Nativity (clearly Flemish, however) near the seat by
the doorway. In this last, observe the quaint head-dress of the
donatrix in the background (an unusual position) as well as the
conventional ox and ass, and the Three Kings approaching in
the upper right-hand corner, balanced by the shepherds listening
to the angels. St. Joseph’s candle is, however, a novelty. I
merely note these points to show how much there may often be
in seemingly unimportant objects. This is officially called an
Adoration of the Shepherds, but if you look into it, you will
see, erroneously. The person entering from behind is a mere
modern spectator. Study well the works in this room and the
next, regarded as a <span class='bold'>starting-point</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the <span class='bold'>passage</span> leading into the next room are a truncated
statue of St. Denis, from his Basilica (to be visited later), and,
beyond it, a group of Hell from the same church. Notice the
usual realistic jaws of death, vomiting flame and swallowing the
wicked. Observe also that souls are always represented as
nude. Opposite this, a mutilated fragment of St. Denis bearing
his head, and accompanied by his two deacons, St. Rusticus
and St. Eleutherius. I have not hitherto called attention to
these two attendant deacons, but you will find them present in
almost all representations of St. Denis. (Look for them among
the paintings.) Try to build up your knowledge in this way, by
adding point to point as you proceed, and afterwards returning
to works earlier visited, which will gain fresh light by comparison
with those seen during your more recent investigations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Enter Room II: <span class='bold'>Salle du Moyen Age</span>. Notice, first, the
fragments by the window; those numbered 19 to 22 are good
typical examples of the rude work of the Romanesque period
(10th to 12th cents.). 23, beside them, shows the improvement
which came in with the Gothic epoch, as well as the distinctive
<span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span>
Gothic tone in execution,—softer, and rounder, with just a touch
of foolish infantile simplicity or inanity. Observe all the other
heads here, and compare their dates, as shown on the labels.
Two beautiful angels, from the tomb of the brother of St. Louis,
will indicate this gradual advance in execution, wholly anterior
to any Renaissance influence. On the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> side of the window,
notice particularly an admirable head of the Virgin, 76, and
another near it, from the cathedral of Sées. On the pillar, St.
Denis bearing his head. Every one of these capitals and heads
should be closely noted, with reference to the dates shown on
the label. In the little Madonna on the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> hand window, observe
a nascent attempt to introduce an element of playfulness
which is characteristically French. This increases later. It
develops into the grace—the somewhat meretricious grace—of
more recent French sculpture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now turn to the body of the room. R wall, 53, an excellent
angel. Beyond it, the Preaching of St. Denis; observe that he
is here attended by his two faithful deacons; the gateway indicates
that he preaches at Paris. Such little side-indications are
common in early art: look out for them. Above it, Christ in
Hades, redeeming Adam and Eve, as the first fruits of the souls,
from Limbo; the devil bound in chains on the ground beneath
them; you saw several similar works at Cluny. Further on,
another Madonna and Child, with the same attempt at playfulness;
notice here Our Lady’s slight simper, a very French
feature; the Child carries a goldfinch, which you will frequently
find, if you look for it, in other representations, both French and
Italian. The coloured relief of Pilate recalls those in the ambulatory
at Notre-Dame. (Read in every case the date and
place whence brought here.) Beneath it are the Flagellation,
Bearing of the Cross, Crucifixion, and Entombment, which may
be profitably compared with other examples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(If, after observing the French type of Madonna in these
rooms, and the few Burgundian works they contain, you have
time to revisit the Mediæval Sculpture at Cluny—Room VI,
ground floor—as I strongly advise you to do, you will find that
<span class='bold'>Burgundian art</span> in the Middle Ages was quite distinct from
French, and had types of its own, approximating to the
Flemish, and still more to the German. This is well seen in
<span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>
the Burgundian Madonna and St. Catherine at Cluny. For
study of the style, it is a good plan to stop at <span class='bold'>Dijon</span> on your
way to or from Switzerland.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The end of the room is occupied by a Gothic doorway from
a house in Valencia (Spain), which may be contrasted with the
scarcely later Renaissance example from the Palazzo Stanga.
On its top is an Annunciation, representations of which are
frequent in similar situations; we saw one on the façade of
St. Étienne du Mont; in such cases, the Madonna is almost
always separated by some form of wall, door, or ornament
from the angel Gabriel; here, the finial represents the usual
pot of lilies. Below it, a very characteristic French Madonna,
again slightly smirking, and with the Child bearing the goldfinch.
Note once more the royal air, the affected ladylike
manner, given to the Madonna in early French sculpture and
painting. To its <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, a similar regal painted Madonna. To the
<span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, gorgeous coloured statue of King Childebert, of the 13th
cent.: this once stood at the entrance to the beautiful refectory
of the Abbey of St. Germain-des-Prés (see later) which
Childebert founded, and where the king was buried. L wall,
fragment of a coloured stone relief, Judas receiving payment:
of the same type as those in Notre-Dame. Further on, a
similar Kiss of Judas. (Compare this with several specimens
at Cluny.) The mutilated state of many of these fragments
is in several instances due to the Revolution. All the other
statues and fragments in this compartment should be carefully
examined, including the strange scene from a Hell, and the stiff
wooden Madonna, on pedestals in the centre. By the doorway,
painted Virgin and Child,—the Madonna under a little canopy,
and very typical of French conceptions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Room III, <span class='bold'>Salle de Michel Colombe</span>, represents the
<span class='bold'>advance</span> made <span class='bold'>in French plastic art</span> during the last half
of the 15th cent., and the beginning of the 16th cent., in
some cases independently of the Italian Renaissance. The
bust of François I<sup>er</sup>, in bronze, on a pedestal near the door,
may be compared, both for spirit and likeness, with the (very
wooden) contemporary portraits of the same king in the French
School upstairs. It has all the stiffness and archaic fidelity
of early portraiture, with the usual lack of artistic finish.
<span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>
Note such little points as that the king wears the collar of his
order, with the St. Michael of France as a pendant. Near
the window, fragments of work displaying Renaissance influence.
One, a relief of the Return of the Master, from the
Château de Gaillon (built by Cardinal d’Amboise, minister of
Louis XII, and one of the great patrons of the Renaissance
in France), exhibits the beginning of a taste for secular,
domestic, and rustic subjects, which later became general.
(Early work is all sacred—then comes mythical—lastly, human
and contemporary.) Note on the opposite side, the fine bronze
of Henri Blondel de Rocquencourt, under Henri II. The
Apollo and Marsyas is strongly Renaissance—a mythic subject
(see the Perugino upstairs). The Massacre of the Innocents
exhibits Renaissance treatment of a scriptural scene. The
<span class='bold'>centre of the room</span> is occupied by fine <span class='bold'>bronzes</span> of the school
of Giovanni da Bologna, a Frenchman who worked in Italy
and forms a link between the art of the two countries. Observe
the decorative French slenderness and coquetry of form,
combined with the influence of the Italian Renaissance. The
Mercury—light and airy—is a replica of Giovanni da Bologna’s
own famous statue in the Bargello at Florence. The Mercury
and Psyché beside it is a splendid example of Giovanni da
Bologna’s school, by Adrian de Vries. Notice the French
tinge in the voluptuous treatment of the nude, and the slenderness
and grace of the limbs. The bronze statue of Fame,
from the tomb of the Duc d’Epernon, exhibits in a less degree
the same characteristics. It is obviously suggested by Giovanni’s
Mercury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Along the wall to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, the most noticeable work is the
splendid <span class='bold'>**</span>marble relief of St. George, by the great French
sculptor Michel Colombe, produced for the chapel of the
Château de Gaillon; recollect all these Gaillon objects, and
their connection with one another: the château was erected
under Louis XII, at the dawn of the French Renaissance, and
much of its work, like this fine relief, shows a considerable
surviving Gothic feeling. You will see the façade of the château
later at the École des Beaux-Arts. It is interesting to
compare this splendid piece of sculpture with the little Della
Robbia in the Italian rooms, and the painting by Raphael
<span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>
upstairs: the dragon here is a fearsome and very mediæval
monster; but the St. George and his horse are full of life and
spirit; and the fleeing Princess in the background is delicately
French in attitude and conception. The dragon is biting the
saint’s lance, which accounts for its broken condition in the
Raphael and the Mantegna. Comparison of the various St.
Georges in this collection, indeed, will give you an admirable
idea of the way in which a single conventional theme, embracing
always the very same elements, is modified by national
character and by the individuality of the artist. To understand
this is to have grasped art-history. (Note that the legend
of St. George itself is in one aspect a Christianisation of the
myth of Perseus and Andromeda.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beneath the St. George stands a fine Dead Christ, also
exhibiting characteristic French treatment. The somewhat
insipid but otherwise excellent Madonna and Child, on a
pedestal close by, is admirable as exemplifying the transformation
of the smirking Madonnas of the Middle Ages into the
type of the Renaissance. The Death of the Virgin, near it,
from St. Jacques-de-la-Boucherie (of which only the tower now
remains), suggests to one’s mind the riches which must once
have belonged to the demolished churches of Paris,—mostly,
alas! destroyed at the great Revolution. Observe in this work
the figures of the attendant apostles, the Renaissance architecture
of the background, and the soul of the Madonna ascending
above, escorted by angels, to heaven. More naïve, and
somewhat in the earlier style, is the Nativity above it, flanked
by the two St. Johns, the Baptist and the Evangelist. The
tomb of Philippe de Commynes also illustrates the older
feeling, as yet little influenced by the Italian irruption. Note
that the works which betray the greatest Italian influence are
chiefly connected with the <span class='bold'>royal</span> châteaux and palaces of
François I<sup>er</sup> and his Italianate successors, or their wives and
mistresses; the <span class='bold'>nation</span> as yet is little touched by the new
models.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bronze tomb of Alberto Pio of Savoy, by Ponzio, on the
other hand, exhibits strongly the Italian tendency, and should
be compared with the earlier recumbent tombs, behind in Room
I, as showing the survival of the mediæval type, transmuted
<span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>
and completely revivified. The same may be said of the tomb
of Philippe de Chabot, which, however, is more distinctively
French and much less markedly Italian. See how the early
prostrate effigies become here recumbent: the figure, as it were,
is trying to raise itself. In comparing the various works in this
room, endeavour to note these interlacing points of resemblance
and difference. The beautiful Genii above are parts of the same
tomb, and are exquisite examples of the minor work of the
French Renaissance. Passing the Italian Tacca’s admirable
bust of Giovanni da Bologna, we come to an excellent Entombment,
of the French School, from St. Eustache, which should
be compared with earlier specimens in the adjacent rooms.
Beneath it, a fine fragment by Jean Cousin. Still lower, a
Passage of the Red Sea, beginning to display that confused
composition and lack of unity or simplicity which spoiled the
art of the later 16th and 17th centuries. The fine Madonna
and Child close by should be compared with the very similar
example opposite, as well as with its predecessors in other
centuries. (Comparison of varying versions of the <span class='it'>same</span> theme
is always more instructive than that of different subjects.) The
tomb of Abbot Jean de Cromois, with its Renaissance framework,
shows a survival of earlier tendencies; as does also that
of Roberte Legendre, though the figures of Faith and Hope
(Charity is missing) are distinctly more recent in type than the
recumbent effigy. Those who have time to notice and hunt up
the <span class='bold'>coats of arms</span> on the various tombs will often find they
shed interesting light on their subjects. Observe also the
<span class='bold'>churches</span> from which these various monuments have been
removed, a point which will fit in with your previous or subsequent
knowledge of the buildings in many cases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>last window</span> contains a few works of the <span class='bold'>German
School</span>, which it is interesting to compare with their French
contemporaries. Thus, the shrewd, pragmatical, diplomatic
head of Frederick the Pacific, a coarse, cunning self-seeker, is
excellently contrasted with the French portrait-busts. The
little scene of the Holy Family, after Dürer, which should be
closely studied, is essentially German in the domestic character
of its carpenter’s shop, in the broad peasant faces of its
Madonna and attendant angels, in the playful touches of the
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>
irreverent cherubs, and in the figure of the Almighty appearing
in clouds at the summit of the composition. The Kiss of Judas,
opposite it, is also characteristically German; notice the brutal
soldiers, whose like we have seen in woodwork at Cluny: the
bluff St. Peter with the sword is equally noteworthy; in the
background are separate episodes, such as the Agony in the
Garden; though officially ascribed to the French School, this
is surely the work of a deft but unideal German artist. Do not
neglect the many beautiful <span class='bold'>decorative fragments</span> collected in
this room, nor the fine busts, mostly of a somewhat later
period.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now enter Room VIII, the <span class='bold'>Salle de Jean Goujon</span>. The
magnificent collection of works contained in this room embraces
the <span class='bold'>finest specimens of French Renaissance work</span> of the
school of the great artist whose name it bears, and of his equally
gifted contemporary, Germain Pilon. They represent the plastic
side of the School of Fontainebleau. In the centre is Jean
Goujon’s <span class='bold'>**</span>Huntress Diana, with her dogs and stag; it was
probably executed for Diane de Poitiers, and comes from her
Château d’Anet, presented to her by her royal lover. (Note
all the works from the Château d’Anet, which is a destroyed
museum of the art of the Renaissance.) Observe on the base
the monogram of H. and D., which recurs on contemporary
portions of the Louvre. The decorative lobsters and cray-fish
on the pedestal should also be noted. Diana herself strikes
the keynote of all succeeding French sculpture. Beautiful,
coquettish, lithe of limb, and with the distinctive French
elegance of pose, this figure nevertheless contains in it the
germs of rapid decadence. It suggests the genesis of the 18th
century, and of the common ormolu clock of commerce. Step
into the next room and compare it with the Nymph of Fontainebleau,
by Benvenuto Cellini. You will there see how far the
Florentine artist approached the French, and how much the
Frenchman borrowed from the Florentine. Walk round and
observe on either side this the most triumphant work of the
French Renaissance. Observe also its relations to the Diana
of Versailles, in the Classical Gallery—brought to France by
François I<sup>er</sup>,—and its general debt to the antique, as well as to
contemporary Italy.
<span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps still more beautiful is the exquisite <span class='bold'>**</span>group of the
Three Graces, supporting an urn, by Germain Pilon, intended to
contain the heart of Henry II, and commissioned by Catherine
de Médicis. It once stood in the Church of the Celestines.
Here again one sees the delicacy and refinement of the French
Renaissance, with fewer marks of its inherent defects than in
Jean Goujon’s statue. Sit long and study this exquisite trio—which
the Celestines piously described as the Theological Virtues.
Walk round it and observe the admirably natural way in which
the figures are united by their hands in so seemingly artificial a
position. The charming triangular pedestal is by the Florentine
sculptor, Domenico del Barbiere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third object in the centre of the room is the exquisite
group of the <span class='bold'>**</span>Four Theological Virtues, in wood, also by
Germain Pilon, which, till the Revolution, supported the reliquary
containing the remains of Ste. Geneviève, in St.
Étienne-du-Mont, and earlier still in the old church now replaced
by the Panthéon. These are probably the finest figures
ever executed in this difficult material. The faces and attitudes
deserve from every side the closest study. If you have entered
into the spirit of these three great groups in the centre of this
room, you have succeeded in understanding the French Renaissance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, begin at the further wall, in the body of the Salle, and
observe, first, the exquisite reliefs of <span class='bold'>*</span>Tritons and Nereids,
with <span class='bold'>**</span>Nymphs of the Seine, by Jean Goujon. Read the labels.
We shall visit hereafter the Fountain of which these graceful
and delicate reliefs once formed a portion. The Nymph to the
<span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> is one of the loveliest works ever produced by its sculptor,
and is absolutely redolent of Renaissance spirit. It indicates
the change which had come over French handicraft, under the
influence of its Italian models, at the same time allowing the
national spirit to shine through in a way which it never succeeded
in doing in contemporary painting. Beneath it are two
noble figures in bronze, from the tomb of Christopher de Thou,
attributed to an almost equally great artist, Barthélemy Prieur.
Frémin Roussel’s Genius of History still more markedly anticipates
more recent French tendencies. It is intensely modern.
Germain Pilon’s monumental bronze of René Birague prepares
<span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span>
us for the faults of the French works of this style in the
Louis XIV period. Mere grandiosity and ostentation are here
foreshadowed. The centre of the next wall is occupied by
Germain Pilon’s fine chimney-piece, with Jean Goujon’s bust
of Henri II as its central object. The decorative Renaissance
work on this mantel should be closely studied, as well as that—so
vastly inferior—on the adjacent later columns of the age of
Louis XIV. Barthélemy Prieur’s exquisite bronzes from the
tomb of the Constable Anne de Montmorency also breathe
a profoundly French spirit. The figures represent Justice,
Courage, and Abundance. Germain Pilon’s too tearful Mater
Dolorosa (painted terra-cotta) close by, from the Sainte
Chapelle, indicates the beginnings of modern French taste in
church furniture. His recumbent tomb of Valentine Balbiani,
on the other hand, is admirable as portraiture; but the genius
of the artist is only fully displayed in the repulsive figure of
the same body seen emaciated in death and decomposition
beneath it. Barthélemy Prieur’s recumbent figure of Anne
de Montmorency shows survival of the older type, doubtless
due to the prejudices of patrons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above it is an admirable piece of Renaissance sculpture, by
Jean Goujon, for the decoration of the rood-loft (now removed)
in St. Germain l’Auxerrois. The rare beauty of the existing
one at St. Étienne-du-Mont (by a far inferior artist) enables
us to estimate the loss we have sustained by its disappearance.
The Deposition, in the centre, marked by the highly classical
style and secular or almost sensuous beauty of its Maries, and
the anatomical knowledge displayed in its Dead Christ, should
be contrasted with earlier specimens in adjacent rooms. In
the accompanying figures of the four Evangelists, notice how
earlier conceptions of the writers and their attendant symbols
have been altogether modified by a Raphaelesque spirit. You
would scarcely notice the eagle, angel, bull, and lion (compare
Sacchi upstairs), unless you were told to look for them. Germain
Pilon’s Agony in the Garden displays an exactly similar
transformation of a traditional subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some interesting works are placed <span class='bold'>near the windows</span>. In
the <span class='bold'>first</span> is a fragment from the pulpit of the Church of the
Grands Augustins in Paris, by Germain Pilon, representing
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span>
Paul Preaching at Athens. The bald head and long beard
of the Apostle of the Gentiles are traditional; the figure is
modelled on Italian precedents; here again the female auditors
are introduced entirely in the classical spirit, and treated with
Renaissance love for exuberant femininity. Nominally sacred,
such works as this are really nothing more than sensuous and
decorative in their tendencies. The Church accepted them
because they were supposed to be artistic. Other fragments
opposite exemplify the same baneful tendency, pregnant with
decadence. Christ and the Woman of Samaria (with her
classical urn) is a subject we have already met with elsewhere:
here, it is much permeated by Renaissance feeling. The
Preaching of St. John Baptist gives the artist an opportunity
for introducing two attractive female listeners. In the <span class='bold'>second
window</span>, the contrast between the comparatively archaic St.
Eloi from Dijon, and the Nymphs of the school of Jean Goujon,
is sufficiently abrupt to point its own moral. Germain Pilon’s
Entombment may be instructively compared with Jean Goujon’s
and others; the Magdalen here is an admirable figure. Glance
across from one to the other and note the resemblance. Even
at this late date, how close is the similarity in the attitudes
of the chief actors! They almost correspond figure for figure:—Joseph
of Arimathæa, and then Nicodemus, supporting the
dead Christ; next, the fainting Madonna, in the arms of one
of the Maries; then, the Magdalen at the foot, with her box
of ointment, and the mourning women; all stand in the same
relations in the two reliefs. If you will compare both paintings
and sculptures in this manner, you will learn how much
the artist borrowed in each case from predecessors, and exactly
how much is his own invention. Opposite the Entombment
are other Nymphs of the school of Jean Goujon, and a characteristic
transitional figure of a Donor and his Family, showing
a distinct attempt to treat an old motive by the new methods;
<span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> the Donor, kneeling, introduced by his patron, St. John
Baptist; <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, two ladies of his family, introduced by a sainted
bishop and an abbot; near them, their children, kneeling, but
with some genial allowance for the sense of tedium in infancy;
in the background, Renaissance architecture, with quaint bas-reliefs
of Samson carrying off the gates of Gaza; the Resurrection
<span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>
and Appearance to the Apostles; the Supper at Emmaus;
and Jonah emerging from the mouth of the whale. Works
like these, often artistically of less importance, nevertheless not
infrequently throw useful light on the nature of the conditions
under which the sculptor worked—the trammels of tradition,
the struggle to wriggle out of the commands of a patron, who
desires to see reproduced the types of his childhood. The
<span class='bold'>third window</span> contains some charming but mutilated fragments
from the tomb of the Duc de Guise: more figures by
Germain Pilon; and a thoroughly Renaissance Awakening of
the Nymphs, attributed (with little doubt) to Frémin Roussell.
Germain Pilon’s good bust of Charles IX strikes the keynote
of the king’s vain and heartless character. The baby Christ,
by Richier, though evidently suffering from water on the brain,
is otherwise a charming early French conception of soft innocence
and infantile grace. Notice, above this, a somewhat
transitional Pietà, placed as a votive offering (like so many
other things) in the (old) church of Ste. Geneviève, with the
kneeling donor represented as looking on, after the earlier
fashion. The Judgment of Daniel, attributed to Richier, though
splendid in execution, forms an example of the more crowded
and almost confused composition which was beginning to
destroy the unity and simplicity of plastic art. As a whole,
the works in this room should be attentively and closely studied,
illustrating as they do the one exquisite moment of perfect
fruition, when the French Renaissance burst suddenly into full
flower, to be succeeded almost at once by painful degeneracy
and long slow decadence. I would specially recommend you
to compare closely the more classical works of this room with
those in the adjoining Salle de Michel Ange in order to recognise
the distinctively French tone as compared with the Italian.
The importance of these various rooms, of both nationalities,
to a comprehension of Paris and French art in general, cannot
be over-estimated. By their light alone can you fully understand
the fabric of the Louvre itself, the Luxembourg, the
Renaissance churches, the tombs at St. Denis, and above all,
Fontainebleau, St. Germain, Versailles itself, and the entire
development of architecture and sculpture from François I<sup>er</sup>
to the Revolutionary epoch. Especially should you always
<span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span>
bear in mind the importance of works from the Château de
Gaillon (early) and Château d’Anet (full French Renaissance).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the <span class='bold'>vestibule</span>, as you pass out, notice a copy in bronze,
probably by Barthélemy Prieur, of the antique Huntress Diana,
the original of which we have already noticed in the Classical
Gallery. It helps to accentuate the direct dependence of French
Renaissance sculpture upon the classical model as well as upon
that of the contemporary Italians. Observe that while each
of these arts is based upon the antique, it necessarily follows
the antique models <span class='it'>then and there</span> known to it—not the “Venus
of Milo” discovered in 1820, or the figures from Olympia of
quite recent discovery.</p>

<h4 id='ch3b-2-3'><span style='font-size:x-small'>3.</span> MODERN SCULPTURE.</h4>

<p class='pindent'>This collection is entered by a separate door in the Cour du
Louvre, marked E on Baedeker’s plan. It takes up the
development of French plastic art at the point where the last
collection leaves off. It is, however, of vastly inferior interest,
and should only be visited by those who have time to spare
from more important subjects. The decline which affected
French painting after the age of the early Renaissance had
even more disastrous effects in the domain of sculpture. I
will not, therefore, enumerate individual works in these rooms,
but will touch briefly on the characteristics of the various
epochs represented in the various galleries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Salle de Puget</span> contains sculptures of the age of Louis
XIII and XIV, for the most part theatrical, fly-away, and
mannered. They are grandiose with the grandiosity of the
school of Bernini; unreal and over-draperied. Like contemporary
painting, too, they represent official or governmental
art, with a courtier-like tendency to flattery of monarchy,
general and particular. A feeble pomposity, degenerating into
bombast, strikes their keynote. Few works in this room need
detain the visitor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Salle de Coyzevox</span> continues the series, with numerous
portrait-busts of the celebrities of the age of Louis XIV,
mostly insipid and banal. The decline goes on with accelerated
rapidity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Salle des Coustou</span>, mostly Louis XV, marks the lowest
<span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>
depth of the degradation of plastic art, here reduced to the
level of Palais Royal trinkets. It represents the worst type of
18th century handicraft, and hardly contains a single passable
statue. Its best works are counterparts in marble of Boucher
and Greuze, but without even the touch of meretricious art
which colour and cleverness add to the craft of those boudoir
artists. Few of them rise to the level of good Dresden china.
The more ambitious lack even that mild distinction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Salle de Houdon</span>, of the Revolutionary epoch, shows
a slight advance upon the preceding (parallel to the later work
of Greuze), and is interesting from its portrait-busts of
American statesmen and French republican leaders. Some of
the ideal works, even, have touches of grace, and a slightly
severer taste begins to make itself apparent. The classical
period is foreshadowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Salle de Chaudet</span>, of the First Empire, answers in sculpture
to the School of David in painting. It is cold, dignified,
reserved, and pedantic. It imitates (not always at all successfully)
the antique ideals. The best works in this room are
Canova’s; but the intention is almost always better than the
execution. A sense of chilly correctness distinguishes these
blameless academic works from the natural grace and life of
antique Greek sculptors. They lie under the curse which
pursues revivals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Salle de Rude</span> contains plastic work of the Restoration,
the July Monarchy, and the Second Empire. It answers
roughly to the romantic School of Delaroche in painting.
Several of these almost contemporary works have high merit,
though few of them aim at that reposeful expression which is
proper to sculpture. Some, indeed, trench upon the domain
of painting in their eager effort to express passing emotion
and action. Picturesqueness and sensuousness are their prevailing
features. Nevertheless, the room, as a whole, exhibits
the character of a real renaissance, such as it is, from the
mediocrity of the last century, and the bleak propriety of the
classical revival. Too many of the works, however, are aimed
at the taste of the Boulevards. They foreshadow that feeling
which makes too much modern sculpture attempt to catch
the public by flinging away everything that is proper to the
<span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span>
art. The desire for novelty is allowed to override the sense of
beauty and of just proportion: repose is lost; dignity and
serenity give place to cleverness of imitation and apt catching
at the momentary expression.</p>

<h3 id='ch3b-3'>III. THE SMALLER COLLECTIONS.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>other collections</span> at the Louvre appeal for the most
part rather to the <span class='bold'>specialist</span> than to the general public. They
are for workers, not for sight-seers. The <span class='bold'>Egyptian Museum</span>,
for example, to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> as you enter the Cour du Louvre by the
main entrance, contains, perhaps, the finest collection of its
sort in all Europe. You must, of course, at least walk through
it—especially if you have not seen the British Museum. The
objects, however, are sufficiently indicated for casual visitors
by means of the labels; they need not be enumerated. The
opposite wing, to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> as you enter, contains the <span class='bold'>Assyrian
Collection</span>, inferior on the whole, especially in its bas-reliefs,
to that in the British Museum. Beyond it, again, to the left,
lie a group of rooms devoted to the <span class='bold'>intermediate region</span>
between the sphere of <span class='bold'>Assyrian and Greek art</span>. These
rooms ought certainly to be examined by any who wish to
form some idea of the origin and development of Hellenic
culture. The first two rooms of the suite contain <span class='bold'>Phœnician</span>
works,—important because the Phœnicians were the precursors
of the Greeks in navigation and commerce in the
Mediterranean, and because early Greek art was largely based
on Phœnician imitations of Assyrian and Egyptian work, or
on actual Egyptian and Assyrian objects imported into Hellas
by Phœnician merchants. These Semitic seafarers had no
indigenous art of their own; but they acted as brokers
between East and West, and they skilfully copied and imitated
the principal art-products of the two great civilisations on
whose confines they lay, though often without really understanding
their true import. The Phœnicians were thus the
pioneers of civilisation in the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Room</span> IV, beyond these two, contains more Phœnician
antiquities, and others from <span class='bold'>Cyprus</span>, an island inhabited by
Greeks or half Greeks, but one in which this imported Oriental
<span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>
culture earliest took root and produced native imitations.
Examine these objects as leading up to, and finally correcting,
the <span class='it'>archaic</span> Greek work ill represented by a few objects
in the Salle de Phidias. The <span class='bold'>Salle de Milet</span>, beyond, contains
Greek antiquities from <span class='bold'>Asia Minor</span>, some of which
indicate transition from the Assyrian to the Hellenic type.
Examine these from the point of view of development.
The reliefs from the temple of Assos in Mysia show an
early stage in the evolution of Asiatic Greek art. Compare
them with the archaic objects in the Salle de Phidias. It
must be borne in mind that civilised art entered Greece from
Assyria, by way of Phœnicia, the Hittites, Lydia, Phrygia,
the Ionian cities in Asia Minor, and the Islands of the
Archipelago. These intermediate rooms should therefore be
studied in detail from this point of view, dates and places
being carefully noted, as illustrating the westward march of
art from Nineveh to Athens. The last hall of the suite, the
<span class='bold'>Salle de Magnésie</span>, on the other hand, contains works from
<span class='bold'>Ephesus</span> of a late Greek period, representing rather a slight
barbaric deterioration than a transitional stage. These collections,
most important to the student of Hellenic culture, may
be neglected by hurried or casual visitors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Salle Judaïque</span>, to the right, under the stairs, contains
the scanty remains of the essentially inartistic Jewish people,
interesting chiefly from the point of view of Biblical history.
The famous and much-debated <span class='bold'>Moabite Stone</span>, recording
the battles of King Mesa of Moab with the Jews in <span style='font-size:smaller'>B.C.</span> 896,
is here preserved. It is believed to be the earliest existing
specimen of alphabetic as opposed to hieroglyphic or ideographic
writing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is, however, one group of objects in the Louvre, too
seldom visited, which no one should omit to inspect if time
permits him. This is the admirable <span class='bold'>**</span>Dieulafoy Collection
of <span class='bold'>Persian Antiquities</span>. To arrive at it, go to the front of
the Old Louvre, facing St. Germain l’Auxerrois, as for the
previously noted series. Enter by the principal portal, and
turn to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, through the Assyrian collection, whose winged
bulls and reliefs of kings you may now inspect in passing,
if you have not done so previously. Mount the staircase at
<span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>
the end, and, at the landing on the top, turn to your <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, when
you will find yourself at once face to face with the collection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>First Room</span> contains merely Græco-Babylonian objects
(of a different collection) which need only be inspected by
those whose leisure is ample. They illustrate chiefly the effect
of Hellenic influence on Asiatic models. On the entrance wall
of the <span class='bold'>Second Room</span> is the magnificent <span class='bold'>*Frieze of Archers</span>
of the Immortal Guard, in encaustic tiles, with cuneiform
inscriptions, from the Throne Room of Darius I. This
splendid work, mere fragment though it is of the original,
gives in its colour and decorative detail some idea of the
splendour of the Palace of the Persian monarchs. The
colours are those still so prevalent in Persian art, showing a
strong predominance of blues and greens, with faint tones of
yellow, over red and purple, which latter, indeed, are hardly
present. Round the rest of the walls are ranged decorative
fragments from the Palace of Artaxerxes Mnemon. Opposite
the archers is another magnificent frieze of <span class='bold'>angry lions</span>, from
the summit of the portals in the last-named palace. The next
compartment of the same room contains the <span class='bold'>*Base of a Column</span>
and a <span class='bold'>**Capital</span> of the same, also from the Palace of Artaxerxes
Mnemon:—two figures of bulls supporting between them the
enormous wooden rafters of the ceiling. These gigantic and
magnificent figures form perhaps the most effective and
adequate supports for a great weight to be found in any school
of architecture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next room contains the admirable <span class='bold'>reconstruction</span> of
the Palace, when entire, showing the position on the walls of
either pylon, and the manner in which the columns supported
the colossal roof. If, from inspection of this model, we return
to the base and capitals themselves, we shall be able to judge
what must have been the magnificent and gigantic scale of
this Titanic building, the effect of which must have thrown
even the Temple of Karnac into the shade. At the side are a
<span class='bold'>lion</span> and <span class='bold'>winged bull</span>, which help to complete the mental
picture. This collection, unique in Europe, serves to give one
an idea of the early <span class='bold'>Persian civilisation</span> which can nowhere
else be obtained, and which helps to correct the somewhat
<span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span>
one-sided idea derived from the accounts of Greek historians.
On no account should you miss it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>minor art-objects</span> of the Louvre, though of immense
value and interest in themselves, may be largely examined by
those who have the time in the light of their previous work at
Cluny. The collection of <span class='bold'>drawings</span>, one of the finest in Europe,
is mostly interesting to artists. That of <span class='bold'>smaller Mediæval and
Renaissance Objects</span> contains works closely similar to those at
Cluny, including admirable <span class='bold'>ivory-carvings</span>, fine <span class='bold'>pottery</span> (the
best of which is that by <span class='bold'>Palissy</span>, and the <span class='bold'>Henri II ware</span>),
together with Oriental faïence, bronzes, etc. The <span class='bold'>Greek Vases</span>,
again, of which this Museum contains a magnificent collection,
are mainly interesting to Hellenic specialists. For the casual
visitor, it will suffice to examine one or two of them. The
<span class='bold'>Etruscan Antiquities</span> give a good idea of the civilisation of
this ancient race, from which, both in earlier and later times,
almost all the art, poetry, and science of Italy has proceeded.
Though entirely based upon Greek models, the Etruscan productions
betray high artistic faculty and great receptive powers
of intellect. Among the <span class='bold'>minor Greek works</span>, none are more
interesting than the beautiful little terra-cotta <span class='bold'>figures</span> from
<span class='bold'>Tanagra</span> in Bœotia, which cast an unexpected light on one
side of Greek art and culture. Examine them as supplementing
the collection of antique sculpture. These <span class='bold'>figurines</span>, as they
are called, were produced in immense quantities, chiefly in
Bœotia, both for household decoration and to be buried with
the dead. They were first moulded or cast in clay, but they were
afterwards finished by hand, with the addition of just such
accessories or modifications as we have seen to obtain in the
case of the statues in the antique gallery. Finally they were
gracefully and tastefully coloured. Nothing better indicates the
universality of high art-feeling among the ancient Greeks than
the extraordinary variety, fancy, and beauty of these cheap
objects of every-day decoration; while the unexpected novelty
given by the slightest additions or alterations in what (being
moulded) is essentially the same figure throws a flood of light
upon the methods of plastic art in higher departments. Look
out for these exquisite little figures as you pass through the
(inner) rooms on the South Side of the old Cour du Louvre, on
<span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span>
the First Floor. Most of them will be found in Room <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> of
Baedeker’s plan. Almost every visitor is equally surprised and
charmed by their extremely modern tone of feeling. They are
alive and human. In particular, the <span class='bold'>playfulness</span> of Greek art
is here admirably exemplified. Many of them have touches
of the most graceful humour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here, again, do not suppose that because I do not specify,
these minor works of art are of little importance. If you have
time, examine them all: but you must do so by individual care
and study.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The neighbouring <span class='bold'>Salle des Bijoux</span> contains beautiful antique
jewellery; do not miss the very graceful gold <span class='bold'>tiara</span> presented
to the Scythian King Saitaphernes by the Greek city of Olbia
in the Crimea—a lovely work of the 3rd century <span style='font-size:smaller'>B.C.</span> Its
authenticity has been disputed, but not its beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Galerie d’Apollon</span> contains, among many objects of
considerable interest, the Reliquary which encloses the Arm of
Charlemagne—who, having been canonized, was duly entitled
to such an honour. The Reliquary of St. Henry, and the
Chasse of St. Louis are also well worthy of inspection. Notice,
too, the Hand of Justice, used at the coronation of the French
Kings. But all these objects can only be properly studied, by
those who wish to investigate them, with the aid of the official
catalogue. I shall recur at greater length to a few of them after
our return from St. Denis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When you have learnt Paris well, go often to and fro between
these rooms of the Louvre, the Mediæval and Renaissance
Sculpture, the halls at Cluny (particularly Room VI, with its
French architectural work), and the older churches, such as St.
Germain-des-Prés, Notre-Dame, St. Denis, etc. Thus only
can you build up and consolidate your conceptions.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>A special small collection, to which part of a day may well be
devoted, is the <span class='bold'>Early Christian Sculpture</span>, to which I have
already briefly alluded, in the first room to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> as you
enter the Renaissance Galleries in the Cour du Louvre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The centre of the hall is occupied by a good Early Christian
<span class='bold'>sarcophagus</span>, with a cover not its own, sufficiently described
as to origin on the label. The front towards the window
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>
represents the True Vine, surrounding the “X&nbsp;P,” which form
the first two letters of the name of Christ in Greek, inscribed in
a solar circle, and with the Alpha and Omega on either side of
it. This figure, repeated on various works in this room in
slightly different shapes, is known as a <span class='bold'>Labarum</span>. It forms,
after Constantine (who adopted it as his emblem and that of
the Christianized Empire), the most frequent symbol on early
Christian monuments. Note modern reproductions on the
frieze of this apartment. Its variations are numerous. At the
ends, are other True Vines and a better Labarum, with a Star
of Bethlehem. The back has the same devices repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wall nearest the entrance, several <span class='bold'>inscriptions</span>, among
which notice the frequency of the Labarum, with the two birds
pecking at it,—a common Early Christian Symbol. Below
them, good early <span class='bold'>sarcophagus</span>. On its end, remote from
window, Daniel in the Lions’ Den, a traditional representation,
of which an extremely rude barbaric degradation may be
noticed, high up, near the door which leads into the Della
Robbia room, adjacent. In Early Christian art certain subjects
from the Old and New Testaments became conventionalised,
and were repeated on numerous works; of which this
scene of Daniel is an example. Observe here that Old
Testament subjects are frequent; while Madonnas are rare,
and saints almost unknown. Further on, on the ground,
sarcophagus representing <span class='bold'>Christ with the Twelve Apostles</span>.
The treatment here, in spite of slight Oriental tendencies (compare
the Mithra reliefs) is on the whole purely classical. Now,
the great interest in this room is to watch the way in which
classical styles and figures passed slowly from pagan types into
Christian, and again from the debased classical types of the
later Empire into those of Romanesque or Gothic barbarity.
As an example of this surviving pagan element, see, on the wall
to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> of this sarcophagus, <span class='bold'>Elijah taken up to Heaven</span> in a
chariot of fire, and leaving his mantle to Elisha. Here, the
Jordan is represented, in truly pagan style, by a river-god
reclining on an urn and holding water-weeds. Such river-gods
were the conventional classical way of representing a river (see
the Tiber here, and the Nile of the Vatican, reproduced in the
Vestibule): and Christian artists at first so represented the
<span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>
Jordan, as in the Baptism of Christ (in mosaic) in the Baptistery
of the Orthodox at Ravenna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above the sarcophagus of Christ and the Twelve Apostles is
an extremely beautiful <span class='bold'>altar-front</span> from the abbey of St. Denis
(read label) with a cross and palm trees, the True Vine interlacing
it, and the characteristic wave-pattern, which you may
note on many other works in this room. This is the most
beautiful piece of early Romanesque or intermediate Christian
carving in this collection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the centre of the Elijah wall, below, a sarcophagus with a
very Oriental figure of the <span class='bold'>Good Shepherd</span>—a frequent early
Christian device. Compare this figure with the plaster cast of
a similar statue from Rome, near the Della Robbia doorway.
Compare the marked Orientalism of face, form, and foot-gear,
with the Mithra reliefs. Above it, Scenes from the Life of
Christ:—Blessing the Children, Christ and Peter, the Woman
of Samaria, etc.; treatment quite classical. Still higher,
sarcophagus-front of Christ and the Twelve Apostles; workmanship
becoming decadent; architecture, classical in the
centre, passing at the sides into early Romanesque or Constantinian
and Diocletianesque, as in some of the other examples
in this room. L of it, Abraham’s Sacrifice of Isaac, with rather
late architecture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the other objects in this room should be carefully examined,
and their place of origin noted. The symbols and the
frequent Oriental tinge should also be observed. Likewise, the
absence of several ideas and symbols which come in later. Note
that there are no crucifixions, sufferings, or martyrdoms; the
tone is joyous. Many of the minor objects have their own value.
Thus, the fish, by the entrance door, is a common Early Christian
symbol, because the Greek word ΙΧΘΥΣ [Greek: ICHTHYS] formed the initials
of the sentence, “Jesus Christ, Son of God, the Saviour”; and
its sacred significance is here still further emphasised by the
superimposed cross—a symbol, however, which does <span class='it'>not</span> belong
to the very earliest ages of Christendom. So, on the opposite
wall of the window, notice the little Daniel in the Den of Lions,
and the youthful beardless Christ with a halo. The longer you
study these interesting remains, the more will you see in them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those who have had their interest aroused in Early Christian
<span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>
art from the examination of this room will find the subject best
pursued at Rome (Catacombs and Lateran) and Ravenna, where
we can trace the long decline from classical freedom to Byzantine
stiffness and Gothic barbarism, as well as the slow upward
movement from the depths of the early Romanesque style to the
precursors of the Renaissance. For the chronological pursuit
of this enticing subject the best order of visiting is Rome,
Ravenna, Bologna, Pisa, Siena, Florence. For a list of the
extensive literature of the subject, see Dean Farrar’s <span class='it'>Christ in
Art</span>.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span><h1 id='ch4'><span style='font-size:smaller'>IV</span><br/> THE NORTH BANK (RIVE DROITE)</h1></div>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>[P</span></span>ARIS, <span class='bold'>north of the river</span>,—which is for most purposes
the practical Paris of business and pleasure (and of
the ordinary tourist) at the present day—has grown by slow
degrees from small beginnings. The various rings of its
growth are roughly marked on the Map of Historical Paris.
The wall of <span class='bold'>Philippe Auguste</span> started from near the easternmost
end of the existing Louvre, and, after bending inland
so as just to enclose the Halles Centrales, reached the river
again near the upper end of the Île St. Louis. It thus encircled
the district immediately opposite the primitive islands:
and this innermost region, the Core of the Right Bank, still
contains most of the older buildings and places of interest
<span style='font-size:smaller'>N.</span> of the river. <span class='bold'>Étienne Marcel’s</span> walls took a slightly wider
sweep, as shown on the Map; and by the time of <span class='bold'>Louis XIII</span>.
the town had reached the limit of the <span class='bold'>Great Boulevards</span>,
which, with their southern prolongation, still enclose almost
everything of historical or artistic interest in modern Paris.
The fact that the kings had all their palaces in this northern
district was partly a cause, partly perhaps an effect, of its rapid
predominance. The town was now spreading mainly northward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The increase of the royal power brought about by Richelieu,
and the consequent stability and internal peace of the kingdom,
combined with the complete change in methods of defence
which culminated in Vauban, enabled Louis XIV to <span class='bold'>pull down
the walls</span> of Paris altogether, and to lay out the space covered
by his predecessor’s fortifications in that series of broad curved
avenues which still bears from this circumstance the name of
Boulevards (“bulwarks” or ramparts). The original line so
<span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>
named, from the Bastille to the Madeleine, is ordinarily spoken
of to this day simply as “the Boulevard.” All the others called
by the same have borrowed the title, mostly at a very recent
date, from this older girdle. Gradually, the <span class='bold'>Faubourgs</span> which
gathered beyond the line of the inner city, as well as beyond
the artificial southern prolongation of the Boulevards by which
Louis continued his circle, with true French thoroughness of
system, on the southern bank, have entirely coalesced with the
central town, and at last enormously outgrown it. Nevertheless,
to the end, the Paris of Louis XIV continues to enclose
almost all that is vital in the existing city. Especially is
<span class='bold'>Paris within the Great Boulevards</span> to this day the Paris
of <span class='bold'>business and finance</span>: it includes the Bourse, the Banque
de France, the Bourse de Commerce, the chief markets, the
Post Office, the Ministries of Finance, Marine, and Justice, the
Hôtel de Ville, numerous Government Offices, the principal
wholesale warehouses, financial firms, and agencies, and almost
all the best shops, hotels, banks, and business houses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even the inner circle itself, again, <span class='it'>within</span> the Boulevards,
has been largely transformed by modern alterations, especially
in that extensive reorganisation of the city inaugurated under
Napoleon III by Baron Haussmann. In the brief itinerary
which follows, and in which I have endeavoured to give the
reader in two short walks or drives some general idea of the
development of the Right Bank, with its chief points of interest,
I shall indicate roughly the various ages of the great thoroughfares,
and note with needful conciseness the causes which at
various times led to their construction.]</p>

</div>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='ch4a'>A. THE CORE OF THE RIGHT BANK</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Start from the <span class='bold'>Place de la Concorde</span>, and walk eastward
along the Rue de Rivoli, in the direction of the Louvre. (If
you like, the top of an omnibus will suffice as far as the Hôtel
de Ville.) The Place de la Concorde itself, though old in
essence, is, in its present form, quite a modern creation, having
been laid out in 1854 under the Second Empire, when it was
decorated with the 8 seated stone figures, wearing mural crowns,
and representing the chief cities of France (including Strasbourg).
The Luxor obelisk (age of Rameses II) was erected
<span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>
in the Place, in its simpler form, by Louis Philippe, in 1836.
The two handsome large buildings on the <span style='font-size:smaller'>N</span> side are still
earlier in date, age of Louis XV: one of them is occupied by
the Ministère de la Marine—that nearest the Tuileries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Proceed along the <span class='bold'>Rue de Rivoli</span>, driven through this part
of Paris by Napoleon I. He was a Corsican, and admired his
native Italian arcaded streets, which he transplanted to Paris
in this thoroughfare, and in the Rues Castiglione, and des Pyramides,
all of which commemorate his victories. The form,
however, is ill-adapted to the North, being draughty and sunless:
and Frenchmen have never cared for the Rue de Rivoli,
which is the street of strangers and especially of Englishmen.
The native Parisian has always preferred to sun himself on the
Boulevards. To your <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> are the <span class='bold'>Gardens of the Tuileries</span>,
still much as they were laid out under Louis XIV by Le Nôtre,
in the formal style which well accorded with that artificial
epoch. They contrast markedly with the newer portion, further
<span style='font-size:smaller'>E</span>, on the site of the Palace, laid out by the present Republic
in something like the English manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>L, as you proceed, lies the Rue Castiglione, another of
Napoleon’s arcaded streets, leading up to the Place and
Colonne Vendôme. R, a little further on, you come abreast
of the Louvre, the first Pavillon being part of the connecting
wing of the Tuileries. L, the Rue des Pyramides, again
Napoleonic: and further <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, opens up the <span class='bold'>Place du Palais Royal</span>,
with the façade of the Palace showing behind it. This
part, marked Conseil d’Etat, is the original building (much
restored and rebuilt): it was erected by Richelieu for his own
occupation, and bore at first the name of Palais-Cardinal.
Occupied after his death by the widow of Louis XIII, it took
its present name: and was later the residence of the notorious
Regent, Philippe d’Orléans, and of his scheming grandson,
Philippe Égalité. The garden behind, with an arcade of shops,
now half deserted and uninteresting, which also bears the name
of Palais Royal (almost to the exclusion of the original building)
was laid out and let in this curious way by the Regent, as
a commercial speculation. As a relic of the past, it is worth
ten minutes’ visit, some time in passing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Continue along the Rue de Rivoli, eastward, till you reach
<span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span>
the Rue du Louvre. So far, you have been passing through
the Paris of Louis XIII, Louis XIV, and the Empire; but now
you are abreast with the wall of Philippe Auguste, and enter
<span class='bold'>the Core of the Right Bank</span>. Old as this part is, however,
by origin, few of its buildings are mediæval; almost everything
has been re-made in the Renaissance period. To your <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> lies
the site of the old <span class='it'>château</span> of the Louvre, and opposite it, the
mediæval Church of St. Germain l’Auxerrois, one of the few
remaining, which thus announces your arrival in early Paris
from the town of Napoleon and François I<sup>er</sup>. (The Rue du
Louvre itself is of very recent origin, and leads to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> to the
new Post Office.) Still going east, you have on your <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> the
tower of St. Jacques, once another fine mediæval church, now
demolished. (Near it, on the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, opens out the modern Boulevard
de Sébastopol, forming part of the great trunk line from
<span style='font-size:smaller'>N</span> to <span style='font-size:smaller'>S</span>, which was a principal feature in the Haussmannizing
plan. It is known, further <span style='font-size:smaller'>N</span>, as the Boulevard de Strasbourg,
and <span style='font-size:smaller'>S</span> as the Boulevard du Palais, and the Boulevard St. Michel.)
Keep on till you come to the <span class='bold'>Hôtel de Ville</span>, the centre of
the town on the North Bank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old Hôtel de Ville, which this building replaces, was
erected in 1533, under François I<sup>er</sup>, by an Italian architect,
in emulation of the similar buildings in Italy and the Low
Countries. It was afterwards largely added to at various times,
and played an important part in the history of Paris. This
first Hôtel de Ville, however (a handsome Renaissance building),
was unfortunately burned down during the internal struggles
of 1871. The present edifice was erected shortly after, in much
the same style, but on a larger scale; a walk round the <span class='bold'>exterior</span>
will help to piece out the visitor’s conception of Renaissance
Paris. Note here once more the <span class='it'>pavillons</span> at the angles, and
other features which recall the Louvre. A visit to the interior
is quite unnecessary for any save those hardened sight-seers
who desire to inspect the decorations and arrangements of
purely contemporary buildings. The sole reason for coming
to the Hôtel de Ville at all, indeed, is the desirability of recognising
its historic site, and understanding that here, by the hall
of the old Prévôt des Marchands and the seat of the revolutionary
Commune of Robespierre’s period, you stand at the
<span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>
heart of La Ville—the Paris of the merchants. The building
is occupied by the Préfet de la Seine—the Department which
practically coincides with Paris. The Place in front of it, now
called after the Hôtel itself, is the old Place de Grève, the
famous place of execution under the old Monarchy,—almost
equally conspicuous in the history of the great Revolution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Earlier still than the building of François I<sup>er</sup>, a “Hostel de
Ville” had stood upon the same site, purchased for the purpose
by Étienne Marcel, Prévôt des Marchands, the real founder of
the Paris municipality—to whom, therefore, a bronze equestrian
statue has been erected in the little square facing the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Hôtel de Ville forms a convenient centre from which to
begin the exploration of the core of the northern city. Walk
round to the back (with a second fine <span class='it'>façade</span>) and, between the
two handsome barracks, you see towering before you the front
of the church of</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>St. Gervais.</p>

<p class='noindent'>This is an old church, remodelled: and, unlike most of the
churches in the older part of Paris, it does <span class='it'>not</span> commemorate a
local saint. Gervasius and Protasius, to whom it is dedicated,
were two very doubtful martyrs of the persecution under Nero,
whose names, bodies, and resting-place were miraculously and
conveniently revealed to St. Ambrose at Milan (<span style='font-size:smaller'>A.D.</span> 387) at the
exact moment when he needed relics for the church he had
built, and which is now dedicated to him—the most interesting
building in that beautiful city. St. Germain, bishop of Paris,
brought back some relics of these saints in 560: and thenceforth
St. Gervais and St. Protais became great objects of cult,
like St. Stephen, in the Frankish city. (They are frequent
subjects of French pictures in the 17th century.) This church,
dedicated to them, probably occupies the site of one built by
St. Germain in their honour. It was begun in 1212, added to
and completely altered in 1420, and finally remodelled in front
in the later Renaissance or classic manner. Most of the building
as it stands is late Gothic; but you must go to the side to
see it: the incongruous classic <span class='it'>façade</span>, illustrating the Doric,
Ionic, and Corinthian orders, was added by Debrosse in 1616.
Notice the coldness and bareness of this pseudo-classical front,
as compared with the rich detail of the earlier mediæval exteriors.
<span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span>
Almost the only breaks are the figures, on either side,
of the two martyrs to contain whose relics the church was
built. The sides, enclosed in houses which go close up to the
wall, show the earlier architecture. Most churches in Paris
were so walled up during the 17th century. The tower, and
the aspect of the streets at the side, are very characteristic of a
set of old effects now seldom visible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>interior</span> is chiefly noticeable for its great height, and
for its interesting Late Gothic architecture. The patron saints,
with their palms of martyrdom, stand on either side of the
High Altar. The chapels at the <span style='font-size:smaller'>S</span> side should be examined
separately: in one is a good stained glass window by Pinaigrier
(restored) of the Judgment of Solomon. Notice to what saint
each is dedicated. The beautiful flamboyant Lady Chapel, behind
the choir, contains good modern frescoes, illustrating the
mystic titles of the Blessed Virgin, whose history is shown in
the stained glass of the windows, also by Pinaigrier, but very
much restored. These scenes the reader will now, I trust, be
able to follow for himself—the birth, education, marriage, etc.,
of the Virgin, with the events of her life as recorded in the
Gospels, and her death and assumption. Good Pietà (Christ
mourned by angels) as you return on the <span style='font-size:smaller'>N</span> side, with some
excellent paintings—Martyrdom of St. Juliet, etc. I do not
enlarge, as I hope the reader is now able to follow the lead I
have given him in previous churches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From St. Gervais, walk a little way along the <span style='font-size:smaller'>N</span> side of the
church, enclosed in its curious envelope of houses, till you
come to the Mairie of the IVth Arrondissement. Then, turn up
into the Rue de la Verrerie, along which continue till you
reach the side of the church of <span class='bold'>St. Merri</span>, almost hidden from
view by a wall of houses. The <span class='it'>façade</span> is round the corner, in
the Rue St. Martin. This is one of the few remaining mediæval
churches in this district. St. Merri (Abbot Mederic of Autun)
was a (historical) saint of the 7th century, local and early. He
had a hermitage on this spot (then in the woods), and was
finally buried here. The shrine over his tomb became the
centre of a Parisian cult, and several churches rose successively
above his body. The present one was not built till 1520; it is
nevertheless a good late Gothic building. But notice the
<span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span>
decline from the purity of Notre-Dame and the exquisite lightness
of St. Louis’s chapel. Handsome flamboyant doorway,
one mass of sculpture: statues of 12 Apostles, with symbols of
their martyrdoms, all restored, after being destroyed in the
Revolution. The <span class='bold'>interior</span> is interesting, but spoilt in 17th
century: good stained glass, badly injured. I bring you here
mainly for the sake of the reminiscences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Continue straight on through characteristic old streets, to the
modern Boulevard de Sébastopol, which cuts right through the
core of Paris. Cross it and take the first turn to the left (as
you walk northward) observing the marked contrast of the
modern thoroughfare to the narrow streets we have just been
traversing. Go along the Rue de la Reynie, and continue for
one block, till you see, a little obliquely to your right, the</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>Square des Innocents.</p>

<p class='noindent'>In the centre rises the <span class='bold'>Fontaine des Innocents</span>, designed by
Pierre Lescot, with beautiful and appropriate sculptured figures
of nymphs, bearing urns of water, by Jean Goujon. The
fountain originally stood with its back to the Church of the
Innocents, demolished in 1783. It has been re-erected here,
with a fourth side added (to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>S</span>), and has been much altered
by the addition of a base and cupola. Nevertheless, it still
remains a beautiful and typical example of French Renaissance
architecture and sculpture. The coquettish reliefs, indeed, are
not perhaps more lovely than those which adorn Jean Goujon’s
portion of the Louvre; but they are nearer to the eye, and the
scale enables one to judge of the entire effect more truthfully.
The other exquisite nymphs which we saw in the Renaissance
Sculpture at the Louvre, were originally part of the same
fountain. The pretty little square in which the fountain stands
is characteristic of the many democratic public gardens of
Paris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Proceed diagonally across the square, and continue along the
North side of the Halles Centrales, till the east end of</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>St. Eustache</p>

<p class='noindent'>with its characteristic French <span class='it'>chevet</span>, comes in view before you.
At the Pointe St. Eustache, as you cross the roadway, look up
the vistas of un-Haussmannized Paris, again contrasting vividly
with the broad Rue de Turbigo, which runs hence to the Place
<span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span>
de la République. Do not enter at the first door at which you
arrive—the one in the <span class='it'>chevet</span>—a rather good one—but continue
along the South side of the church, observing as you pass the
beautiful transept, with fine rose window, noble Renaissance
portal, and a stag’s head with the crucifix (emblem of St.
Eustace) surmounting the gable. Go on round the corner to
the gaunt, bare, lumbering, and unimposing late Renaissance
or classical <span class='it'>façade</span>. In this you see the worst aspect of the
decadent Renaissance architecture of Louis XIV—no saints,
no archways. The door to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> gives access to the <span class='bold'>interior</span>.
In any other town but Paris, so splendid a building, rivalling
many cathedrals, would attract numerous visitors. Here, it is
hardly noticed. This is the church of the “Dames de la
Halle” or market-women, who may often be observed in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have already seen in brief at Cluny the main elements of
the story of <span class='bold'>St. Eustace</span>, the saint who was converted by the
apparition of the Christ between the horns of the stag he was pursuing.
Though not a local martyr, St. Eustace early obtained
great consideration in Paris. But the first church here was
one to St. Agnes: look out for memorials of her throughout
the building. St. Eustace had practically supplanted her as
early as 1223: his church, after many enlargements, was finally
pulled down under François I<sup>er</sup>, and the present splendid
Renaissance edifice erected in its place in 1532; completed in
1640. It is a strangely picturesque and unique building. St.
Eustache, indeed, displays Renaissance architecture in <span class='bold'>a
transitional state</span>, endeavouring vainly to free itself from the
traditions of the Gothic. In general plan, and in the combination
of all its parts, it is in essence a Gothic cathedral; but
its arches are round, and its detail and decorative work are all
conceived in the classical spirit of the Renaissance. If you
wish to see the difference between such a church and one in
which developed Renaissance methods have finally triumphed,
you must visit St. Sulpice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Note three things about St. Eustache: (1) it replaces a church
to St. Agnes, who is still one of its two patronesses; (2) it
is the great <span class='bold'>musical</span> church of Paris; (3) it is the church
of the markets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately on entering, stand in the centre of the nave,
<span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>
and look up the church towards the choir and <span class='it'>chevet</span>. The
enormous size of the building will at once strike you. Notice,
too, the tall, round arches of the nave and aisles, the triforium
above them (best seen from the aisles), and, higher still, the
clerestory rising above the aisle-vaulting. The proportions
are admirable. Observe also the roof, essentially Gothic in
plan, though with an incongruous substitution of round for
pointed arches. But note that all these quasi-Gothic constructive
features are combined with <span class='bold'>classical columns</span> and
pilasters of the three great orders—Doric, Ionic, Corinthian—superimposed,
and with such Renaissance detail as masks,
cherubs, and other later decorative features.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now walk up the <span class='bold'>R aisle</span>. Everything in this church is,
of course, comparatively modern, but still rich in symbolism.
Most of the chapels have their names inscribed upon them—an
excellent feature. The first, containing Franciscan
Saints, has a good modern stained-glass window, representing
the Saints and Patrons of the Order—St. Francis, St. Louis,
etc. Observe the frescoes in the various chapels, and note
their applicability to the saints to whom they are dedicated.
I need not now enlarge upon this point. For example, the
chapel of the Souls in Purgatory has a relief of Christ bound
to the pillar—<span class='it'>His</span> purgatory—(a portion of it is preserved
here) and a fresco representing mourning souls below, with
triumphant ones in heaven. Observe from this point the
beautiful Renaissance detail of the aisles and of the vaulting
in the ambulatory, or passage behind the choir. Do not
overlook the chapels of St. Agnes (co-patroness) and St. Cecilia,
the inventress of the organ and patroness of music. The
<span class='bold'>transepts</span> are very short, but are decorated with good rose-windows
and other excellent semi-Gothic detail. Walk round
the <span class='bold'>ambulatory</span>, noticing as you go the various chapels with
their polychromatic decoration and their appropriate frescoes.
Thus, that of St. Anne contains a representation of the Saint
educating her daughter the Virgin. Note also on your <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> as
you go the delicate work of the choir-screen, and the excellent
vaulting and decoration of the lofty <span class='bold'>choir</span>. The Lady Chapel
behind the choir is not wholly pleasing. It contains a good
18th century statue of the Virgin and Child by Pigalle.
<span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>
Observe particularly in the North part of the ambulatory the
chapel of Ste. Geneviève, with scenes from her legend. The
chapel of St. Louis, next it, contains excellent modern frescoes
from his life, by Barrias, and a fine stained-glass window of
his education, with his mother, Blanche of Castille, looking
on, beneath a canopy marked with fleurs-de-lis and the three
castles of Castille. One fresco represents him taking the
Crown of Thorns to the Sainte Chapelle. Observe these little
historical reminiscences: they add interest. Pleasing reliefs
in the <span class='bold'>North transept</span> of St. Cecilia and King David, representing
music, for which this church has always been celebrated,
especially on St. Cecilia’s Day and Good Friday. They
stand for Psalms and Hymns—the Jewish and the Christian
psalmody. Notice, again, the figure of St. Agnes with her
lamb, between the doorways, a tribute to the earlier dedication
of the building. Above it, good stained-glass window of the
Annunciation, with traditional details. (Do not be content
to notice merely the points to which I call attention, but
observe for yourself as you go the other figures, with their
meaning and connection. To spell it all out is half the
pleasure.) Above the Holy Water vessel in this Transept is
a figure of Pope Alexander I, who first sanctioned the use
of Holy Water, accompanied by angels. Beneath it, the
baffled and disappointed demons, fleeing from the consecrated
water. The next chapel contains the <span class='bold'>relics of St. Eustace</span>
and his children, martyrs. It is, perhaps, a little characteristic
of modern feeling that the half-mythical namesake saint of
the church should thus be relegated to a subordinate chapel
in the edifice originally erected to his honour. The pictures
are imitated from those in the Catacombs at Rome. Notice,
in particular, the fresco of St. Eustace kneeling before the
stag, which displays between its horns the miraculous image;
also, the subsequent scenes of his legend (for which, see Mrs.
Jameson). Beautiful view from this point of the choir and
ambulatory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do not leave this interesting building without having examined
all its details. It contains enough to occupy you for
several hours, and is rich in illustrations of modern Catholic
sentiment. Even the most tawdry bits of its modern church
<span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span>
furniture become of interest when examined as parts of a
consistent whole, falling into their due place in a great system
of belief and the government of conduct. You have not
really understood a church till you have grasped this connection
between its various members. Ask yourself always,
“Why is this here?” and though you may not always be
able to see, the longer you proceed to investigate in this spirit,
the more will the meaning of the whole come home to you.
For example, return to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>S</span> Transept and observe the
figure of St. Gregory: he is the musical Father from whom
the Gregorian chants take their name, and as such deserves
commemoration in the musical church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quitting St. Eustache, you can continue westward a few
steps, and then turn down a short street on the left, which
leads you obliquely to a curious circular building, the Bourse
de Commerce. Skirt round this till you come to its ugly
<span class='it'>façade</span>, and then continue your way into the Rue du Louvre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This short walk will have enabled you to take your bearings
in the heart of the old district north of the river. You can
prolong it a little, if you choose, through the town of Louis
XIV, by walking northward along the Rue du Louvre as far
as the new Post Office, and then turning to the left into the
little circular <span class='bold'>Place des Victoires</span> with its clumsy rearing
equestrian statue of the Grand Monarch. The Place dates from
his reign, and was designed by Mansart. Originally known as
the Place Louis XIV, it was decorated by an earlier statue of the
king, destroyed in the Revolution. The Restoration replaced
it by the present ugly monument. A few steps to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>NW</span>
stands the Church of Notre-Dame des Victoires, begun in 1656,
to commemorate the taking of La Rochelle, the Huguenot
stronghold. It is instructive to compare this building of the
worst period with the Mediæval and Renaissance churches
you have just been examining. The Rue Notre-Dame des
Victoires will lead you hence up to the Bourse (adequately
viewed from outside), whence the brand-new Rue du 4 Septembre
takes you straight back to the Opéra and the centre of
modern Paris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have only walked you here through a small part of this
older town; but if you care to explore the interesting district,
<span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>
rich in Renaissance and even Mediæval buildings, which lies
to the east of the Hôtel de Ville, you cannot do better than
take Mr. Augustus Hare’s <span class='it'>Paris</span> as your guide—a valuable
book, especially rich in historical reminiscences of the Renaissance
period, the epoch of Louis XIV, and the Great
Revolution. Mr. Hare will lead you to many forgotten nooks
of old Paris, which the modest dimensions of the present
handbook are insufficient to deal with. But I advise you only
to explore these less-known byways after you have examined
all the objects of first-rate importance here enumerated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Musée Carnavalet</span>, also in this district, you had
better defer visiting till after you have seen the École des
Beaux-Arts, in the St. Germain Quarter, south of the river.
It will be noticed later.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='ch4b'>B. THE OUTER RING OF LOUIS XIV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>A second, and doubtless to the reader by this time more
familiar walk, round the <span class='bold'>Great Boulevards</span>, will suffice to
give a hasty conception of the Paris of Louis XIV and his
immediate successors. Even if you are already well acquainted
with the route, go over it once more, if only on the top
of an omnibus, at this stage of your investigation, in order
to take your bearings more fully. It must be borne in
mind for the purposes of this walk or ride that in the earlier
mediæval period the district between the Boulevards and the
central core consisted, for the most part, of gardens and fields,
among which were interspersed a few rural monasteries and
suburban churches. These last have long since, of course,
become wholly imbedded in modern Paris, but I will note
as we pass a few earlier objects which it may be interesting
for those who have time to diverge and visit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Start from the Luxor Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde
(noting here and elsewhere the Roman reminiscence of the
bronze ships of Paris on the gas-lamps—as you see them at
the Thermes), and walk up the <span class='bold'>Rue Royale</span>,—the first portion
of the great ring of streets which girdles the city of Louis
XIV. The Rue St. Honoré, to your <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, was, before the
construction of the Rue de Rivoli and the Champs Elysées,
the chief road which led westward out of ancient Paris. The
<span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span>
Porte St. Honoré stood on this site, where it crossed the
barrier by the modern Rue Royale. Beyond it, the street takes
the characteristic name of the Rue du Faubourg St. Honoré;
and all the other streets which cross the girdle similarly
change their name to that of the corresponding Faubourg as
they pass beyond it. These long straggling roads, lined with
houses on the outskirts (Faubourg St. Honoré, Montmartre,
St. Denis, du Temple, etc.), have finally become the chief
residential quarters of the city at the present day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The handsome classical building in front of us is the
<span class='bold'>Madeleine</span>—(Church of St. Mary Magdalen)—the last stage
in the classical mania which substituted Græco-Roman
temples for Christian churches and other edifices. (See
previous stages in St. Paul and St. Louis, the Sorbonne, the
Invalides, the Panthéon, etc.) Begun under Louis XV, it was
not completed till the Restoration. In style it follows the late
Roman variation on the Corinthian-Greek model. Notice,
however, as you approach, that even this Grecian building
bears on its purely classical pediment the stereotyped Parisian
subject of the Last Judgment, with the Angel of the Last
Trump, and the good and wicked to <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> and <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> of the
Redeemer. Only, in this case, St. Mary Magdalen, under
whose invocation, as the inscription states, the church is
dedicated, kneels by the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> side of Christ, imploring mercy
for the wicked. Compare this last term in the treatment of
this old conventional portal-relief with its naïf beginnings
at Notre-Dame and St. Denis. It is also worth while to enter
and inspect the chapels, the paintings and sculpture in which
will reveal their dedications. (See also Baedeker.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Rue Royale forms the first part of the girdle of Louis
XIV. From the Madeleine onward, we enter that wider part
of this girdle which still distinctively bears the name of the
<span class='bold'>Boulevard</span>. To our <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, Baron Haussmann’s quite modern
Bd. Malesherbes opens up a vista of the recent and unsatisfactory
Church of St. Augustin—a great ornate pseudo-Romanesque
building, unhappily accommodated to the space
at the architect’s disposal. Proceeding along the Bd. de la
Madeleine, and then the Bd. des Capucines, we arrive in a
few minutes at the Place de l’Opéra, undoubtedly the central
<span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span>
nodal point of modern Paris. To our <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> stands the great
<span class='bold'>Opéra House</span>, erected at vast expense in the gaudy meretricious
style of the Second Empire, and decorated with good,
but too voluptuous modern sculpture. Two new streets
branch <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> and <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> of it. Walk round them, and so take
the measure of the building. To our <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> the <span class='bold'>Avenue de l’Opéra</span>
has been run diagonally across the older streets of
Louis XIV’s town, towards the Palais Royal and the Théâtre
Français. This is now one of the finest thoroughfares of
the existing town. Nevertheless, the old Boulevard, above all
in this part of its circuit, remains the centre of Parisian life,
thought, and movement. Especially is it the region of cafés
and theatres. Here also the older <span class='bold'>Rue de la Paix</span>, one of
the earliest fine open thoroughfares in Paris, leads to the
irregular octagonal <span class='bold'>Place Vendôme</span>, laid out under Louis
XIV, and said to owe its canted corners to the king’s own
personal initiative. [This Place is a good example of the best
domestic architecture of the Eighteenth Century. Its centre is
occupied by the great <span class='bold'>bronze column</span> (Colonne Vendôme)
originally erected by Napoleon to commemorate his victories.
It was pulled down by the Commune, but (the fragments having
been preserved) was re-erected after the triumph of the National
party. Round it in a long spiral run a series of reliefs,
suggested by those on Trajan’s Column at Rome: but while
the Roman pillar was surrounded by a Forum of several
stories, with open porticoes from which the sculpture could
be inspected, the sculpture on Napoleon’s is quite invisible,
except just at the base, owing to the lack of any similar
elevated platform from which to view it.] The other great
street diverging from the Place de l’Opéra to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, the
Rue du 4 Septembre, leads to the <span class='bold'>Bourse</span> (uninteresting), and
is part of the modern arterial system.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Continuing along the line of Louis XIV’s Boulevards, we
reach next the Bd. des Italiens, and then turn obtusely round
into the Bd. Montmartre. To our <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> lies the Faubourg of that
name, long since swallowed up by the engulfing city. At the
Rue St. Denis (the great north road of Paris), we arrive at one of
the debased classical <span class='bold'>triumphal arches</span> (Porte St. Denis) which
Louis XIV erected in place of the ancient castellated gates.
<span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span>
It is (more or less) decorated with contemporary reliefs representing
his victories; these, and the inscriptions, are worth
examining. Beyond the gate, the road to St. Denis, much
traversed in earlier times by pilgrims, takes the significant
name of Rue du Faubourg St. Denis. A little further on,
the modern trunk line of the (Haussmannesque) Bd. de Sébastopol,
hewn straight through the heart of the earlier town,
intersects the old fortifications, leading <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> to the Cité, and <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>
to the Gare de l’Est, in which direction it is known as the Bd.
de Strasbourg. The next corner, the Rue St. Martin, which
similarly changes its name to that of its Faubourg as it crosses
the limit of the earlier town, is marked by a second of Louis
XIV’s arches, the <span class='bold'>Porte St. Martin</span> (not <span class='it'>quite</span> so ugly), whose
sculpture is again worthy of notice on historical grounds, if not
on artistic. [A little way down the Rue St. Martin to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> lies the
<span class='bold'>Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers</span> (uninteresting internally)
which occupies the site of the former <span class='bold'>Cluniac Priory</span> of St.
Martin-des-Champs, after which the street is still called. This
was one of the principal old monasteries in the belt outside the
girdling walls of Philippe Auguste, though included within
those of Étienne Marcel. It was founded as early as the 11th
century. The Conservatoire itself, as an industrial exhibition,
is hardly worth a visit (except for technical purposes), but it
ought to be inspected for the sake of the old <span class='bold'>church</span> of the
monastery which it contains (enter it to view interior; open on
Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays only) as well as for the fine
<span class='bold'>Refectory</span> of the 13th century, a beautiful Gothic hall, probably
erected by Pierre de Montereau, the architect of the Sainte
Chapelle, who also built the other Refectory, now destroyed,
at St. Germain-des-Prés in the southern Faubourg. A little
further on in the same street is the interesting Gothic church of
<span class='bold'>St. Nicolas-des-Champs</span>, with rather picturesque Renaissance
additions. It stood, when first built, far out in the
country. The fine west porch is of the 15th century. These
buildings are chiefly worth notice as enabling the visitor mentally
to restore the outer ring of monasteries and churches
during the early mediæval period, afterwards englobed in the
town of Louis XIV, and now in many cases adapted to alien
modern uses.]
<span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Return to the main line of the Boulevards, which here become
distinctly shabbier and pass through a poorer district. This
part of Paris is destitute of immediate interest, but should be
traversed in order to give the visitor a just idea of the extent
and relations of the eighteenth century city. We arrive before
long at the Place de la République, formerly <span class='bold'>Place du Château-d’Eau</span>,
now adorned with a new bronze statue of the Republic.
From this Place several more new Boulevards in various directions
pierce through the poorer and densely-populated regions
of eastern and north-eastern Paris. Along the main line, the
Bds. du Temple, des Filles du Calvaire, and Beaumarchais lead
hence through increasingly poorer-looking districts to the <span class='bold'>Place
de la Bastille</span>, where stood the famous strong castle of that
name (Bastille St. Antoine), destroyed in the Revolution. Its
site is now occupied by the <span class='bold'>Colonne de Juillet</span>, erected to
commemorate the Revolution of 1830. Hence the Rue St.
Antoine leads <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> in one line into the Rue de Rivoli near the
Hôtel de Ville. Beyond the line of the Boulevards, <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, it takes
the name of Rue du Faubourg St. Antoine. This was the
region of the poorer and fiery revolutionists of 1789–93.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The district <span class='bold'>within</span> the Boulevards in this direction was in
the Valois period the most fashionable part of Paris. It contained
the old royal palace of the Hôtel St. Paul, together with
numerous other <span class='it'>hôtels</span> of the French nobility. From the Place
de la Bastille, also, new Boulevards diverge in several directions.
You had better return to the centre of the town by the Rue St.
Antoine, where the third turning to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> will lead you direct
into the <span class='bold'>Place des Vosges</span>, a curious belated relic of the Paris
of Henri IV. Its interesting architecture and quiet stranded
air will well repay you for the slight détour, and will suggest to
you the possibility of many similar agreeable walks in the same
district. Mr. Hare will prove a most efficient guide to this
quaint district, for those who have time to explore it thoroughly.
Remember always that the <span class='it'>least</span> important part of Paris,
historically speaking, is the western region which alone is
known to most passing strangers.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>[T</span></span>HE town on the North Side, we saw, was early surrounded
by a <span class='bold'>suburban belt</span> of gardens and monasteries.
A similar zone encircled the old University on the
South Bank. The wall of Philippe Auguste, you will remember,
bent abruptly southward in order to enclose the
abbey of Ste. Geneviève; but an almost more important
monastic establishment was left outside it a little to the west.
This was the gigantic abbey of <span class='bold'>St. Germain-des-Prés</span>, whose
very name betokens its original situation. This rich and
powerful community, whose building covered an enormous
area of ground on the Left Bank, and grew at last into a town
by itself, was originally founded by Childebert I as a thank-offering
for his victory over the Visigoths in Spain in 543.
Childebert, it may be remarked, was one of the most religious-minded
among the Frankish monarchs,—which is why we have
more than once met with his effigy in Gothic sculpture. He
was also one of those few Merovingian kings who especially
made his residence in Paris. On the portal of the other St.
Germain (l’Auxerrois), which has numerous points in common
with this one, we saw him represented with his wife Ultrogothe
and the earlier St. Germain, a naïve way of expressing the fact
that the King and Queen first gave that church to the sainted
bishop. At the Louvre, too, we saw his statue from this very
monastery. Among the sacred objects which Childebert
brought back from Spain was the tunic of <span class='bold'>St. Vincent</span>, the
patron saint of prisoners. When he was besieging Saragossa,
he saw the inhabitants carry this tunic in unarmed procession
round the walls; which so convinced him of its value that he
<span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span>
raised the siege, on condition that he might take the holy
object home with him. He also brought a large rich gold
cross, ornamented with precious stones, from Toledo,—a piece
of jeweller’s work which might probably be compared with the
crowns of the Gothic kings preserved at Cluny. <span class='bold'>St. Germain</span>,
Bishop of Paris (who must not be confounded with his earlier
namesake of Auxerre), recommended to the king the foundation
of a new church and abbey, in order fitly to receive these holy
relics. A church was therefore built in the garden belt outside
the wall, and was originally dedicated (as was natural) to the
Holy Cross and St. Vincent. The latter thus became one of
the local saints of Paris, through its possession of his tunic;
and his effigy may often be seen, with or without that of his
brother deacon St. Stephen, on many of the older buildings of
the city. We noticed him in particular on the portal of St.
Germain l’Auxerrois, and on the frescoes within, though it was
premature then to explain his presence. Note here that
possession of the body of a Saint (St. Denis, Ste. Geneviève)
or of some important relic (St. Vincent’s tunic, St. Martin’s
cloak at St. Séverin) almost invariably gives rise to local
churches, and decides the cult of local patrons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later on, <span class='bold'>St. Germain of Paris</span> having died, was buried in
turn in Childebert’s church of St. Vincent. His body being
preserved here (as it still is), and working many miraculous
cures, it came about in time that St. Vincent and the Holy
Cross were almost forgotten, and the local bishop whose bones
were revered on the spot grew to be the acknowledged patron
of the mighty abbey which surrounded his shrine. Such of
the early Merovingian kings as were buried in Paris had their
tombs in this first church: their stone coffins may still be seen
at the Hôtel Carnavalet. The abbey, which belonged to monks
of the Benedictine order, grew to be one of the most famous in
Europe: its name is still bestowed upon the whole of the
<span class='bold'>Faubourg</span> (long since imbedded in the modern town) of which
it forms the centre. It was to the South Bank what St. Denis
was to Northern Paris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The existing <span class='bold'>church</span>, of course (save for a few small fragments),
is of far later date than the age of Childebert. Most of
the Paris churches and monasteries suffered severely at the
<span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span>
hands of the Normans: even those which were not then burnt
down or sacked, were demolished and rebuilt in a more sumptuous
style by the somewhat irreverent piety of later ages.
This, the present church of St. Germain-des-Prés, belongs for
the most part to the 11th century. It is therefore older than
Notre-Dame or the Sainte Chapelle, and even as a whole than
the greater part of St. Denis. It exhibits throughout that
earlier <span class='bold'>Romanesque</span> style which formed the transitional term
between classical architecture and the pointed arches of the
Gothic period. (What we call “Norman” in England is a
local modification of Romanesque.) Portions of the building,
however, show Gothic tendency; and the upper part is pure
Pointed. Most of the Abbey has long since been swept away;
a small part of the building still remains in the rear of the
existing church. St. Germain should be visited if only on
account of the fact that it is the earliest large ecclesiastical
building now standing in or near Paris. Flandrin’s noble
modern frescoes have given it of comparatively recent years
another form of attractiveness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the Renaissance period, while many of the nobility
fixed their seats in the eastern and north-eastern part of Paris-within-the-Boulevards
on the Right Bank, not a few erected
houses for themselves in the open spaces of the <span class='bold'>Faubourg St.
Germain</span>. The most magnificent of these later buildings is
the <span class='bold'>Palais du Luxembourg</span>, erected for Marie de Médicis,
after the death of Henri IV, by Jacques Debrosse, one of the
best French architects of the generation which succeeded that
of Jean Goujon and Philibert Delorme. It was built somewhat
after the style of the Pitti Palace at Florence, where Marie
was born, and it exhibits the second stage of French Renaissance
architecture, when it was beginning to degenerate from
the purity, beauty, and originality of its first outburst, towards
the insipid classicism of Louis XIII and Louis XIV. It was
for this building that Rubens executed his great series of
pictures from the life of Marie, now in the Louvre; while
Lesueur painted his St. Bruno legends for a Carthusian
monastery within the grounds. The gardens which surround it
are interesting in their way as being the only specimen now
remaining in Paris of Renaissance methods of laying out;
<span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span>
most of the other palaces have gardens designed by Le Nôtre
in the formal style of Louis XIV. The Palace is now occupied
by the Senate: it is practically difficult of access, and the
interior contains so little of interest that it may well be omitted
save by those who can spend much time in being ushered round
almost empty rooms by perfunctory officials. But the exterior,
the gardens, and the Medici fountain should be visited by all
those who wish to form a consistent idea of Renaissance Paris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the same excursion may be easily combined a visit to <span class='bold'>St.
Sulpice</span>, a church which occupies the site of an old foundation,
but which was entirely rebuilt from the ground in the age of
Louis XIV, and which is mainly interesting as the best example
of the cold, lifeless, and grandiose taste of that pompous period.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Faubourg St. Germain</span> and the quarter about it, as
a whole, are still the region of the old noble families. The
western end of this Faubourg, especially about the Quai d’Orsay,
is given over to embassies and political machinery, particularly
that connected with foreign affairs. The South Bank is also
the district of the <span class='bold'>Legislature</span>, in both its branches. The
Quartier Latin, however, has largely overflowed of recent years
into the Luxembourg district and that immediately behind it,
which are now to a great extent occupied by the students,
artists, and other Bohemian classes.]</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Cross the river, if possible, by the Pont de la Concorde.
The classical building which fronts you proclaims itself legibly
on its very face as the <span class='bold'>Chambre des Députés</span>. But it has
borne in its time many other names. This <span class='it'>façade</span> towards the
river is of the age of the First Empire; the main edifice,
however, is much older, being the <span class='bold'>Palais Bourbon</span>, built in
1722 for the Duchesse de Bourbon. In 1790, it was confiscated,
and has ever since been the seat of one or other legislative
body, according to the Government of the moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You can go round to the back, as you pass, to inspect the
original <span class='it'>façade</span>, in the style of Louis XIV, facing the little Place
du Palais Bourbon. The interior is uninteresting, but has a
few good pictures, which should only be visited by those whose
time is unlimited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The river front is on the <span class='bold'>Quai d’Orsay</span>, the centre of modern
<span class='pageno' title='217' id='Page_217'></span>
political and diplomatic Paris. The building to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> of the
Chamber is the official residence of its President; still further
<span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, the Ministère des Affaires Étrangères. The broad thoroughfare
which opens obliquely south-eastward, <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> of the Chamber,
is the Boulevard St. Germain, which we have crossed before
in other parts of its semi-circle. It was Haussmannized in
a wide curve through the quiet streets of the Faubourg, and
the purlieus of the Quartier Latin, with ruthless regularity.
Many of the tranquil aristocratic roads characteristic of the
region lie <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> and <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> of it; their type should be casually
noted as you pass them. Down the Rue de Lille stands the
German Embassy; on the Boulevard itself, <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, the Ministère
de la Guerre, and further on, <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, the Travaux Publics. Other
ministries and embassies cluster thickly behind, about the
diplomatic Rue de Grenelle and its neighbours. To the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>,
again, the Boulevard Raspail, another very modern street, not
yet quite complete, runs southward through the heart of the
Luxembourg district. Continue straight along the Boulevard St.
Germain, till you reach the Place of the same name, with the
church of <span class='bold'>St. Germain-des-Prés</span> full in front of you. (It may
also be reached directly by the Rue Bonaparte; but this other is
a more characteristic and instructive approach to the Abbey
Church which forms the centre of the quarter.) Observe how
the new Boulevard skirts its side, giving a clever effect of its
having always been there; the front of the church is round the
corner in the Rue Bonaparte.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>exterior</span>, with the houses still built against it in places,
though picturesque, has little minute architectural detail. The
massive tower has been so much renewed as to be practically
modern; but the Romanesque arches near the top give it distinction
and beauty. The mean and unworthy porch is of the
17th cent.; the inner portal, however (though its arch has been
Gothicised), belongs to the Romanesque church and is not
without interest. Observe the character of the pilasters and
capitals, with grotesque animals. Statues of St. Germain, of
Childebert and Ultrogothe (as at the other St. Germain) and of
Clovis, etc., which once flanked the door, were destroyed at the
Revolution. In the tympanum are the unusual subjects of the
Eternal Father, blessing, and beneath Him a Romanesque relief
<span class='pageno' title='218' id='Page_218'></span>
of the Last Supper (<span class='it'>not</span>, as commonly, the Last Judgment).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>interior</span> still preserves in most part its Romanesque
arches and architecture; but the lower part of the nave is the
oldest portion (early 12th cent.); the choir is about a century
later. Most of the pillars have had their capitals so modernized
and gilt as to be of relatively little interest, while the decorations,
though good and effective, are in many cases of such a
sort as effectually to conceal the real antiquity of the building.
The church was used during the Great Revolution as a saltpetre
factory, and was restored and re-decorated in polychrome a
little too freely under the Second Empire. A few capitals,
however, notably those of the Baptistery to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> as you enter
retain their antique carving and are worthy of notice; while
even the modern gilt figures on those of the aisle are Romanesque
in character and quaint in conception. (You can
examine some of the old ones which they replace in the garden
at Cluny.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Walk round the church. The architecture of the <span class='bold'>ambulatory
and choir</span>, though later, is in a much more satisfactory condition
than that of the main body. The arches of the first story
are mostly round, but pointed in the apse; those of the clerestory
are entirely Gothic. The detail below is good Romanesque;
study it. Observe the handsome triforium, between the
two stories; and more especially the interesting capitals of the
columns—relics of the original church of Childebert, built into
the later fabric. The choir, on the whole, is a fine specimen of
late 12th cent. work. The Lady Chapel, behind, is a modern
addition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After having thus walked round the aisles and the back of
the choir to observe the architecture, return once more to the
doorway by which you entered and proceed up <span class='bold'>the nave</span>, in
order to notice the admirable modern <span class='bold'>frescoes by Flandrin</span>
(Second Empire). These are disposed in pairs, each containing
subjects, supposed to be parallel, from the Old and New
Testaments. Note in these the constant survival of early
traditions, revivified by Flandrin in accordance with the art of
his own period. The subjects are as follows:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Begin on the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>. (1) The Annunciation (treated somewhat
in the traditional manner, the relative positions of the Madonna
<span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span>
and the Angel Gabriel being preserved); typified by the
Almighty appearing to Moses in the Burning Bush, as His first
Annunciation. (2) The Nativity, as the pledge of redemption;
typified or rendered necessary by the Fall. (The New Testament
scenes are of course the usual series; those from the Old
Testament foreshadow them, for which reason they are placed
in the opposite from the chronological order.) (3) The Adoration
of the Magi (reminiscences of the conventional, entirely altered
by Oriental costumes and attitudes of submission); typified by
Balaam blessing Israel—a famous picture. (4) The Baptism in
Jordan (positions conventional, with the three angels to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>
as always); typified by the Passage of the Red Sea. (5) The
Institution of the Eucharist, very original in treatment; typified
by Melchisedec bringing forth bread and wine to Abraham.
Now return by the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> side, beginning at the transept:—(6)
The Betrayal of Christ by Judas; typified by the Sale of
Joseph. (7) The Crucifixion—a very noble picture; typified
by the Offering of Isaac, full of pathos. (8) The Resurrection;
typified by Jonah restored from the sea, the whale being with
great tact omitted. (9) The Keys given to Peter; typified by
the Dispersion of the Nations at Babel. (A little thought is
sometimes required to connect these subjects, which are
occasionally, as in the last pair, rather to be regarded as
opposites than types—the one remedying the other. Thus, the
counterpart to the Dispersal at Babel is Christ’s command to
preach the Gospel to all nations.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above this fine frieze of subject-pictures runs a course of
single figures, grouped in pairs, on either side of the windows
in the clerestory. They are Old Testament characters, from
Adam and Eve onward, ending with John the Baptist, as the
last of the prophets. But as all the characters have their
names legibly inscribed beside them, I need not enumerate
them; all, however, should be observed, especially Adam and
Eve, Miriam, Deborah, and Judith. Hold your hat or a book
to cover the light from the windows, if the glare is too great,
and after a little while you will see them distinctly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now proceed again to the front of the choir. On either
side are other mural paintings, also by Flandrin: <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, The
Entry of Christ into Jerusalem, very beautiful: <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, The
<span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span>
Bearing of the Cross. Round the choir, the Twelve Apostles:
by the pointed arches of the apse, the symbols of the
Evangelists—the angel, lion, bull, and eagle. Above all—an
interesting link with the earlier history of the church—are
the pious founders, Childebert and Ultrogothe; the original
patron, St. Vincent, with his successor, St. Germain; and
finally, Abbot Morard who rebuilt the church, substantially in
its present form, after the Norman invasion. He is thus
commemorated in the beautiful choir which represents the work
of his successor, Abbot Hugues, in the next century.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before leaving, observe, architecturally speaking, how a
Romanesque church of this type leads up to the more
complex arrangement, with chevet and chapels, in Notre-Dame
and later Gothic churches. Note the simplicity and dignity
of the choir. Note also the peculiar character of the vaulting,
comparing it with the later type at Notre-Dame, and especially
with the reversion to much the same form in Renaissance
times at St. Étienne-du-Mont, and St. Eustache. In spite of
its newness, much of the modern decorative work is extremely
effective; indeed, as a specimen of almost complete internal
decoration, this church, notwithstanding the cruel overlaying
of its early Romanesque sculpture by gold and paint, is
perhaps the most satisfactory of any in Paris, except the
Sainte Chapelle. I strongly advise you to sit down for some
time and inspect the capitals built into the aisle, and the
beautiful Merovingian pillars of the triforium, with an opera-glass,
at your leisure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On quitting the church, walk round it for the view on every
side, which is picturesque and characteristic. Behind it, in
the Rue de l’Abbaye, stands an interesting portion of the
16th-century <span class='bold'>Abbot’s Palace</span>—the only remaining relic of
the vast conventual buildings, once enclosed for defence by a
wall and moat, and containing a large lay and clerical population,
like a little city. The sumptuous carved and gilded figure
of Childebert, the founder, in the Mediæval Sculpture Room
at the Louvre, came from the doorway of the old Refectory—a
magnificent work by Pierre de Montereau (the architect of
the Sainte Chapelle)—now wholly demolished. After you have
visited each church, you will often find it pleasant to look
<span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span>
out for such isolated works, divorced at present from their
surroundings, and placed at Cluny or elsewhere. They will
always gain new meaning for you by being thus identified as
belonging to such-and-such an original building. For instance,
in the Christian Antiquities Room at the Louvre, you will find
an interesting capital of a pillar belonging to the Merovingian
church of St. Vincent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now return to the Boulevard St. Germain, which a little
further on occupies the site of the old Abbey Prison, famous
as the scene of the massacres in September, 1792. Take the
Rue Bonaparte on the opposite side, and go straight on till
you reach the <span class='bold'>Place St. Sulpice</span>, with its huge church in
front of you. The building replaces an earlier one to the same
saint: under Louis XIV, when the Faubourg St. Germain was
becoming the quarter of the nobles, it was rebuilt in a style of
ugly magnificence, befitting the maker of Versailles and
Marly.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>St. Sulpice</span>, a vast bare barn, is chiefly interesting, indeed,
as a gigantic specimen of the coldly classical type of church
built under Louis XIV, when Gothic was despised, and even
the Renaissance richness of St. Eustache and St. Étienne was
decried as barbaric. It is a painful monument of declining
taste. The <span class='bold'>exterior</span> is chilly. The <span class='it'>façade</span>, whose sole recommendation
nowadays is its size and its massiveness, is a
triumph of its kind; it consists of two stories, with arcades
of Doric and Ionic pillars superimposed on one another,
and crowned with a pair of octagonal towers, only one of
which is completed. The scanty detail of the sculpture is
of the familiar character of the decadent period. But Fergusson
praises the general effect of the exterior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>interior</span> consists of a cruciform pseudo-classical nave,
with aisles, two bare single transepts, and a choir ending in
a circular apse,—all vast, gloomy, barren, and unimpressive.
The pillars and pilasters have Corinthian capitals, and most
of the sculpture betrays the evil influence of Bernini. The
holy water stoups, by the second pillars, however, are more
satisfactory: they consist of huge shells, presented by the
Republic of Venice to François I<sup>er</sup>, standing on bases by
Pigalle,—an effective piece of decorative work in this unpleasing
<span class='pageno' title='222' id='Page_222'></span>
edifice. As a whole, this chilly interior stands in
marked contrast to the polychromatic richness of St. Germain-des-Prés,
and to the exquisite Gothic detail of Notre-Dame
and St. Germain-l’Auxerrois. The roof and false cupola
contrast very much to their disadvantage with the charming
Renaissance vaulting of St. Étienne-du-Mont and St. Eustache.
Accept this visit as penance done to the age of Louis XIV.
Save historically, indeed, this barren church is almost devoid
of interest. Like everything of its age, it aims at grandeur:
it only succeeds in being gaunt and grandiose. The very
size is thrown away for want of effective vistas and groups
of pillars; it looks smaller than it is, and sadly lacks
furnishing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several of the <span class='bold'>chapels</span> around this disappointing church,
however, contain many good modern pictures: most of them
also bear the names of the saints to whom they are dedicated,
which largely aids the recognition of the symbolism. I enumerate
a few of them for their interest in this matter. <span class='bold'>Right
aisle</span> (1) St. Agnes. Jacob and the angel: Heliodorus expelled
from the Temple: by Delacroix. (2) Chapel of Souls in Purgatory.
Religion brings comfort to the dying; benefit of
prayers for the dead: by Heim. (3) Chapel of St. Roch, the
plague saint. He prays for the plague-stricken: he dies in
prison at Montpelier: by Abel de Pujol. (4) St. Maurice, the
soldier saint. His legend: by Vinchon. <span class='bold'>Left aisle.</span> The
chapels here are chiefly dedicated to the newer humanitarian
saints of Catholicism. (1) St. François Xavier. He resuscitates
a dead man: miraculous cures at his burial: by Lafon. (2)
St. François de Sales. He preaches in Savoy: he gives to Ste.
J. F. Chantal the constitution of his Order of nuns: by Hesse.
(3) St. Paul. His conversion; he preaches at Athens: by
Drolling. (4) St. Vincent de Paul. He founds the hospital for
foundlings, with the Sisters of Charity: he attends the death-bed
of Louis XIII: by Guillemot. <span class='bold'>Chapels of the choir:
L</span> (1) St. John the Evangelist. His martyrdom: and his assumption.
(2) San Carlo Borromeo. He ministers during the
plague at Milan: he gives the sacrament to his uncle, Pius IV,
on his death-bed. (3) Uninteresting. (4) St. Louis the King.
He carries a dying man during the plague: he administers
<span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span>
justice under the oak of Vincennes. <span class='bold'>Lady Chapel</span>, a miracle
of ugliness. Statue of the Virgin on clouds in a recess, by
Pajon, lighted from above, and in execrable taste,—the worst
feature in this insipid and often vulgar building. Bad statues
and frescoes. The other choir chapels on the <span class='bold'>R side</span> are dedicated
to the older patron saints of Paris. (1) St. Denis. His
preaching: his condemnation. (2) St. Martin. He divides his
cloak with the beggar: he resuscitates a dead man. (3) Ste.
Geneviève. She brings food from Troyes during the siege of
Paris: miracles wrought by her relics. (4) Our Lady. Her
Birth: her Presentation in the Temple, interesting as modern
examples of the treatment of these traditional subjects. Over
the door, <span style='font-size:smaller'>N</span> or <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> side, her Death: <span style='font-size:smaller'>S</span> or <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> side, her Assumption.</p>

<p class='pindent'>St. Sulpice has a reputation for good music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Fontaine St. Sulpice, in front of the church, is from
Visconti’s designs, and has appropriate statues of the four great
French preachers—Bossuet, Fénélon, Massillon, and Fléchier.
The pulpit here is still famous for its oratory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From St. Sulpice, the Rue Férou, to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> of the <span class='it'>façade</span>,
leads you straight to the Luxembourg Palace. The long low
building almost directly opposite you as you emerge is the</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>**Musée du Luxembourg,</p>

<p class='noindent'>containing the works of modern French painters. This, of
course, is one of the most important objects to be visited in
Paris; but I do not give any detailed account of it here, because
the pictures themselves are entirely modern, and chiefly
by living painters and sculptors, the various examples being
sent to the Louvre, or to provincial museums, within ten years
of the death of the artist. A visit to this Museum is therefore
indispensable to those who desire to form a just acquaintance
with contemporary art. But nothing in the Gallery demands
historical elucidation. The visitor should provide himself with
the Official Catalogue, which will amply suffice for his needs in
this Gallery. I need hardly say that a proper inspection of it
<span class='it'>cannot</span> be combined in one day with the other objects mentioned
in this Excursion. Devote to it at least one or two
separate mornings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, as we leave the end of the Rue Férou, the
<span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span>
first building on our <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> is the official residence of the President
of the Senate; the second is Marie de Médicis’s</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>Palace of the Luxembourg,</p>

<p class='noindent'>now employed as the seat of the Senate. Walk along its
<span class='it'>façade</span>, the work of Jacques Debrosse, one of the ablest architects
of the later classicizing Renaissance, in order to observe
the modified style of the age of Henri IV and Louis XIII, which
it still on the whole preserves, in spite of modern additions and
alterations. Note the gradual falling-off from the exquisitely
fanciful period of the earlier French Renaissance, which produced
the best parts of the Louvre and St. Eustache; and the
way this building lets us down gently to the bald classicism of
Louis XIV and Perrault. If you know Florence, observe also
the distinct reminiscences of the Pitti Palace. Continue
your walk along the whole of the <span class='it'>façade</span>, as far as the corner
by the Odéon Théâtre,—the subventioned theatre of the
students and the Quartier Latin. Then, turn into the <span class='bold'>garden</span>,
and note the rest of the building, whose <span class='it'>façade</span> towards this
side, though restored under Louis Philippe, more nearly represents
Debrosse’s architecture than does that towards the main
thoroughfare. You need not trouble about the interior: though
it contains a few good modern paintings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>garden</span>, however, is well worth a visit on its own
account, both for the sake of the typical manner in which it is
laid out, and especially for the handsome <span class='bold'>Fontaine de Médicis</span>
by Debrosse, on the side next the Panthéon. The group of
sculpture in the middle represents Polyphemus surprising Acis
and Galatea. Go round to the back, to see the (modern)
Fountain of Leda,—that favourite subject of Renaissance
sculpture. The best way back from this Excursion is by the
Rue de Seine, which leads you past the Marché St.-Germain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another building in this district to which, if possible, the
reader should pay at least one visit, is the <span class='bold'>École des Beaux-Arts</span>
in the Rue Bonaparte. This collection is interesting,
both because it contains a number of valuable fragments of
French Renaissance work, especially architectural, and also
because of its <span class='bold'>Museum of Copies</span>, including transcripts (mostly
very good) of the best pictures of various ages, many of which
are useful to the student of art-history for comparison with
<span class='pageno' title='225' id='Page_225'></span>
originals in the Louvre and elsewhere. Everybody who has
not been to Rome, Venice, and Florence, should certainly try
to visit this Museum; and even those who have made firsthand
acquaintance with the masterpieces of Italian art in their
native homes will find that it sometimes affords them opportunities
for comparison of works widely scattered in the
originals, which can be better understood here in certain of
their aspects than in isolation. The building is open to the
public, free, from 12 to 4 on Sundays; on week-days, non-students
are also admitted from 10 to 4 (except Mondays), on
application to the Concierge (small fee). I strongly advise
a Sunday visit, however, as you are then less hurried, and also
as the door on the Quai Malaquais is open on that day. This
building should, if possible, be made the object of a separate
excursion. It takes a long time to inspect it thoroughly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pass through the Tuileries Gardens, or across the Place du
Carrousel, and traverse the river by the Pont Royal or the Pont
du Carrousel. The second turn to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, after the last-named
bridge, the Rue Bonaparte, will take you straight to the door of
the École. The building occupies the site of the old Couvent
des Petits-Augustins; the convent chapel and a few other
remains of the original works are embedded in it. Enter the
courtyard. Here, during the Great Revolution, the painter
Alexandre Lenoir founded his Musée des Monuments for the
accommodation of the tombs removed from St. Denis and other
churches. To his indefatigable exertions almost alone we owe
the preservation of these priceless Mediæval and Renaissance
relics. Under the Restoration, most of the monuments were
replaced in their original positions, and we shall visit several of
them later at St. Denis. To the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> of the entrance in this <span class='bold'>First
Court</span> is the beautiful <span class='bold'>doorway of the Château d’Anet</span>—that
gem of Early French Renaissance architecture, which was
erected for Diane de Poitiers by Philibert Delorme and Jean
Goujon, by order of Henri II, in 1548: many objects from the
same building we have already seen elsewhere. The portal is
now placed as the entrance to the old <span class='bold'>Abbey Chapel</span>. The
end of this court is formed by part of the <span class='bold'>façade</span> from the
<span class='bold'>Château de Gaillon</span>, erected for the Cardinal d’Amboise,
Minister of Louis XII, and one of the favourite residences of
<span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span>
François I<sup>er</sup>. It presents mixed Renaissance and Gothic
features, as did the sculpture of Michel Colombe from the same
building, which we saw at the Louvre. Both these imposing
works—the portal of Château d’Anet and this <span class='it'>façade</span>—should
be compared with the Italian Renaissance doorway from Cremona
and the Gothic one from Valencia, which we saw in the
collection of sculpture at the Louvre. They are indispensable
to a full comprehension of the French Renaissance. The
Château de Gaillon was destroyed during the Revolution, and
many of its finest monuments are now at the Louvre. If you
have time, after seeing this Museum, go back and compare them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Second Court</span>, beyond the <span class='it'>façade</span>, contains several fragments
of buildings and sculpture, among which notice the
capitals from the <span class='it'>old</span> church of Ste. Geneviève (Romanesque),
and a fine stone basin of the 12th cent., brought from St.
Denis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, return to the First Court, and visit the former <span class='bold'>Chapel</span>.
It contains <span class='bold'>plaster casts</span>, adequately described for casual
visitors by the labels, as well as <span class='bold'>copies of paintings</span>. These
plaster casts, especially those of the pulpit from Pisa, by Nicolò
Pisano, the first mediæval sculptor who tried to imitate the
antique, will enable you to piece out your conception of Italian
Renaissance sculpture, as formed at the Louvre. Do not despise
these casts: they are excellent for comparison. Among the
pictures, notice the copy of Mantegna’s fresco of St. James
conducted to Martyrdom, from the church of the Eremitani at
Padua. The fresco itself is a work of Mantegna’s first period,
and I select this copy for notice because it will help you to fill
in the idea you formed of that great painter from consideration
of his originals at the Louvre. Notice, for example, the strenuous
efforts at perspective and foreshortening; the introduction
of decorated Renaissance architecture; the love of reliefs and
ornament; the classical armour; and many other features
which display the native bent of Mantegna, but not as yet in
the maturity of his powers. Observe, again, the copy of Ghirlandajo’s
exquisite Adoration of the Magi, with its numerous
portraits, disguised as the Three Kings, the Shepherds, and the
spectators, to which I have already called attention when
speaking of Luini’s treatment of this subject in the Louvre.
<span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>
I do not enlarge upon these mere copies, as the originals will
occupy us at Florence or Munich; but the student who has
become interested in the evolution of art will find it a most
valuable study to trace the connection, first, between these
subjects and others like them in the Louvre, and, second, between
these copies of works by various masters and the originals
by the same artists preserved in that collection. Compare,
and compare, and compare again ceaselessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Inner Court, the <span class='bold'>Cour du Mûrier</span>, leads to another
hall, the <span class='bold'>Salle de Melpomène</span>, entered on Sundays direct
from the Quai Malaquais. This room also contains a large
number of <span class='bold'>copies</span> which are valuable for study to those who
have not seen the originals, and which will often recall
forgotten facts in new connections to those who <span class='it'>have</span> seen
them. I would call special attention, from the point of view
of this book, to the good copies of Raphael’s and Perugino’s
<span class='bold'>Marriage of the Virgin</span>: as the originals are respectively at
Milan and Caen (two places sufficiently remote from one
another), the composition of the two can be better compared
here than under any other circumstances. As examples of
development, I shall notice them briefly. Perugino’s is, of
course, the older work. It was painted for a chapel in the
Cathedral at Perugia, where it still hung when Raphael painted
his imitation of it. First look carefully at both works, and
then read these remarks upon them. The Sposalizio or
Marriage of the Virgin, one of the set subjects in the old
series of the Life of Mary, and often used as an altar-piece,
consists traditionally of the following features. In the centre,
stands the High Priest, wearing his robes and ephod—or what
the particular painter takes for such: he joins the hands of
Joseph and the Madonna. Joseph stands always on the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>
side of the picture, which Perugino has rightly assigned to
him; though Raphael, already revolutionary, has reversed this
order. He holds in his hand a staff, which has budded into
lily flowers—the tradition (embodied in the Protevangelion)
being that the High Priest caused the various suitors for
Mary’s hand to place their staffs in the Holy of Holies, as
had long before been done in the case of Aaron, intending
that he whose staff budded should become the husband of
<span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span>
the Holy Virgin. Joseph’s put forth leaves and flowers; and so
this staff, either flowering or otherwise, is the usual symbol by
which you can recognise him in sacred art. Behind Joseph
stand the other disappointed suitors, one or more of whom
always breaks his staff in indignation. Behind Mary stand
the attendant maidens—the Virgins of the Lord—together
with Our Lady’s mother, St. Anne, recognisable by her peculiar
head-dress and wimple. (Compare Leonardo in the Salon
Carré.) A temple always occupies the background. Perugino
took the main elements of this scene from earlier painters.
(You will find numerous examples in the churches and
galleries at Florence and elsewhere.) But he transformed it
in accordance with his peculiar genius and his views of art,
substituting a round or octagonal temple of Renaissance
architecture for the square Gothic building of earlier painters.
Such round buildings were the conventional representation
of the Temple at Jerusalem among Renaissance artists. The
peculiar head-dress and the balanced position are also
characteristic of Perugino. How closely Raphael followed his
master on these points of composition you can see for yourself
by comparing the two copies. But you can also see how
thoroughly he transformed Perugino’s spirit; retaining the
form while altering the whole sentiment and feeling of the
figures. You see in it Perugino’s conception, but Raphael’s
treatment. I have called special attention to these two
pictures because they admirably illustrate the value and
importance of comparison in art. You cannot wholly understand
the Raphael without having seen the Perugino; nor can
you wholly understand the Perugino without having seen the
Ghirlandajos and Fra Angelicos, and Taddeo Gaddis which
preceded it. Go from one to the other of these two pictures
and note the close resemblance even in the marble pavement,
the grouping of each component cluster, and the accessories
in the background. Nay, the more graceful attitude of the
suitor who breaks his staff in the Raphael is borrowed from a
minor figure in the background of the Perugino. It is only by
thus comparing work with work that we can arrive at a full
comprehension of early painting, and especially of the relations
between painter and painter.
<span class='pageno' title='229' id='Page_229'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I will not call special attention to the various other copies
in this Museum. I will merely point out, as casting light on
subjects we have already considered, Verocchio’s Baptism of
Christ, Perugino’s group from the same subject, Raphael’s
Entombment, Botticelli’s Adoration of the Magi, and Madonnas
by Filippo Lippi, Giovanni Bellini, Correggio, and
Mantegna. Many of these can be compared here and
nowhere else. For those who are making a long stay in
Paris, a judicious use of this collection, in conjunction with
the Louvre, will cast unexpected light in many cases on works
in that Gallery which it has been impossible here to describe
in full detail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>Amphithéâtre</span>, approached from the Second Court,
contains in its <span class='bold'>Vestibule</span> a number of <span class='bold'>plaster casts</span>, also
valuable for purposes of comparison. The transitional archaic
period of Greek sculpture, for instance, ill represented at the
Louvre, is here well exemplified by casts from the statues in
the pediment of the Temple of Athenè at Ægina, now in
the Pinakothek at Munich. Compare these with the reliefs
from Thasos in the Salle de Phidias. Similarly, casts of the
Children of Niobe, belonging to the same school as the Venus
of Milo, are useful for comparison with that famous statue.
The Amphithéâtre itself, behind the Vestibule, contains Paul
Delaroche’s famous <span class='bold'>Hémicycle</span>, one of that great painter’s
most celebrated works. Do not think, because I do not specify,
that the other objects in this Museum are unworthy of notice.
Observe them for yourself, and return afterwards to the
Louvre time after time, comparing the types you have seen
here with originals of the same artists and variants of the
same subject in that collection.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>[A</span></span>BOUT six miles north of the original Paris stands the
great <span class='bold'>Basilica of St. Denis</span>—the only church in
Paris, and I think in France, called by that ancient name,
which carries us back at once to the days of the Roman
Empire, and in itself bears evidence to the antiquity of the
spot as a place of worship. Around it, a squalid modern
industrial town has slowly grown up; but the nucleus of
the whole place, as the name itself shows, is the body and
shrine of the martyred bishop, St. Denis. Among the numerous
variants of his legend, the most accepted is that which
makes the apostle of Paris have carried his head to this
spot from Montmartre. (Others say he was beheaded in Paris
and walked to Montmartre, his body being afterwards translated
to the Abbey; while there are who see in his legend a
survival of the Dionysiac festival and sacrifice of the vine-growers
round Paris—Denis=Dionysius=Dionysus.) However
that may be, a chapel was erected in 275 above the grave
of St. Denis, on the spot now occupied by the great Basilica;
and later, Ste. Geneviève was instrumental in restoring it.
Dagobert I, one of the few Frankish kings who lived much in
Paris, built a “basilica” in place of the chapel (630), and
instituted by its side a Benedictine Abbey. The church and
monastery which possessed the actual body of the first bishop
and great martyr of Paris formed naturally the holiest site in the
neighbourhood of the city; and even before Paris became the
capital of a kingdom, the abbots were persons of great importance
in the Frankish state. The desire to repose close to the grave
of a saint was habitual in early times, and even (with the
obvious alteration of words) antedated Christianity—every
wealthy Egyptian desiring in the same way to “sleep with
<span class='pageno' title='231' id='Page_231'></span>
Osiris.” Dagobert himself was buried in the church he
founded, beside the holy martyr; and in later times this very
sacred spot became for the same reason the recognised burial-place
of the French kings. Dagobert’s fane was actually
consecrated by the Redeemer Himself, who descended for the
purpose by night, with a great multitude of saints and angels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The existing Basilica, though of far later date, is the oldest
church of any importance in the neighbourhood of Paris. It
was begun by Suger, abbot of the monastery, and sagacious
minister of Louis VI and VII, in 1121. As yet, Paris itself had
no great church, Notre-Dame having been commenced nearly
50 years later. The earliest part of Suger’s building is in the
Romanesque style; it still retains the round Roman arch and
many other Roman constructive features. During the course
of the 50 years occupied in building the Basilica, however, the
Gothic style was developed; the existing church therefore exhibits
both Romanesque and Gothic work, with transitional
features between the two, which add to its interest. Architecturally,
then, bear in mind, it is in part <span class='bold'>Romanesque,
passing into Gothic</span>. The interior is mostly pure Early Gothic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The neighbourhood to Paris, the supremacy of the great
saint, and the fact that St. Denis was especially the <span class='bold'>Royal
Abbey</span>, all combined to give it great importance. Under Suger’s
influence, Louis VI adopted the <span class='bold'>oriflamme</span> or standard of St.
Denis as the royal banner of France. The Merovingian and
Carlovingian kings, to be sure—Germans rather than French—had
naturally been buried elsewhere, as at Aix-la-Chapelle,
Rheims, and Soissons (though even of them a few were interred
beside the great bishop martyr). But as soon as the <span class='bold'>Parisian
dynasty</span> of the Capets came to the throne, they were almost
without exception buried at St. Denis. Hence the abbey came
to be regarded at last mainly as the <span class='bold'>mausoleum of French
royalty</span>, and is still too often so regarded by tourists. But
though the exquisite Renaissance tombs of the House of Valois
would well deserve a visit on their own account, they are, at St.
Denis, but accessories to the great Basilica. Besides the actual
tombs, too, many monuments were erected here, in the 13th
cent. (by St. Louis) and afterwards, to earlier kings buried
elsewhere, some relic of whom, however, the abbey possessed
<span class='pageno' title='232' id='Page_232'></span>
and thus honoured. Hence several of the existing tombs are of
far later date than the kings they commemorate; those of the
Valois almost alone are truly contemporary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the Revolution, the Basilica suffered irreparable losses.
The very sacred reliquary containing the severed head of St.
Denis was destroyed, and the remains of the martyr and his
companions desecrated. The royal bones and bodies were also
disinterred and flung into trenches indiscriminately. The
tombs of the kings were condemned to destruction, and many
(chiefly in metal) were destroyed or melted down, but not a few
were saved with difficulty by the exertions of antiquaries, and
were placed in the Museum of Monuments at Paris (now the
École des Beaux-Arts), of which Alexandre Lenoir was curator.
Here, they were greatly hacked about and mutilated, in order
to fit them to their new situations. At the Restoration,
however, they were sent back to St. Denis, together with many
other monuments which had no real place there; but, being
housed in the crypt, they were further clipped to suit their fresh
surroundings. Finally, when the Basilica was restored under
Viollet-le-Duc, the tombs were replaced as nearly as possible in
their old positions; but several intruders from elsewhere are
still interspersed among them. Louis XVIII brought back the
mingled bones of his ancestors from the common trench and
interred them in the crypt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Remember, then, these things about St. Denis: (1) It is (or
was), first and above all things, <span class='bold'>the shrine of St. Denis and
his fellow-martyrs</span>. (2) It contains the remnant of <span class='bold'>the
tombs of the French kings</span>. (3) It is <span class='bold'>older</span> in part than almost
any other building we have yet examined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As regards the <span class='bold'>tombs</span>, again, bear in mind these facts. All
the oldest have perished; there are none here that go back
much further than the age of St. Louis, though they often
represent personages of earlier periods or dynasties. The best
are those of the Renaissance period. These are greatly influenced
by the magnificent tomb of Giangaleazzo Visconti at
the Certosa di Pavia, near Milan. Especially is this the case
with the noble monument of Louis XII, which closely imitates
the Italian work. Now, you must remember that Charles VIII
and Louis XII fought much in Italy, and were masters of Milan;
<span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span>
hence this tomb was familiar to them; and their Italian experiences
had much to do with the French Renaissance. The
Cardinal d’Amboise, Louis’s minister, built the Château de
Gaillon, and much of the artistic impulse of the time was due
to these two. Henceforth recollect that though François I<sup>er</sup> is
the Prince of the Renaissance, Louis XII and his minister were
no mean forerunners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Basilica is open daily; the royal tombs are shown to
parties every half-hour; but the attendants hurry visitors
through with perfunctory haste, and no adequate time is given
to examine the monuments. Therefore, <span class='bold'>do not go to St.
Denis till after</span> you have seen the <span class='bold'>Renaissance Sculpture</span> at
the Louvre, which will have familiarised you with the style, and
will enable you better to grasp their chief points quickly.
Also, go <span class='bold'>in the morning, on a bright day</span>: in the late afternoon
or on dark days you see hardly anything.]</p>

</div>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Start from the Gare du Nord. About four trains run every
hour. There is also a tramway which starts from the Opéra,
the Madeleine, or the Place du Châtelet, but the transit is long,
and the weary road runs endlessly through squalid suburbs, so
that the railway is far preferable. Start early. Take your
opera-glasses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the St. Denis station, take the road directly to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> as
far as the modern Parish Church, when a straight street in
front of you (a little to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>) leads directly to the Basilica.
On the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> of the Place in front of the great church is the Hôtel
de Ville, on which it is interesting to notice, high up on the
front, the ancient royal war-cry of “Montjoye St. Denis!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turn to the <span class='bold'>Basilica</span>. The <span class='bold'>façade</span>, of the age of Abbot
Suger, is very irregular. It consists of two lateral towers, and
a central portion, answering to the Nave. Only the south
tower is now complete; the other, once crowned by a spire,
was struck by lightning in 1837. Observe the inferiority in
unity of design to the fine <span class='it'>façade</span> of Notre-Dame, the stories of
the towers not answering in level to those of the central portion.
We have here the same general features of two western
towers and three recessed portals; but Notre-Dame has improved
upon them with Gothic feeling. The lower arches are
<span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span>
round and Romanesque. The upper ones show in many cases
an incipient Gothic tendency. The <span class='bold'>rose window</span> has been
converted into a clock. On either side of it, in medallions, are
the symbols of the four Evangelists. Observe the fine pillars
and Romanesque arcade of the one complete tower. Also, the
reliefs of kings of Israel and Judah in the blind arcade which
caps the third story in both towers. The coarse and ugly
battlements which spoil the front are part of the defensive wall
of the Abbey, erected during the English wars in the 14th
century. Behind them, a little way off, you can see the high
and pointed roof of the nave, crowned by the statue of the
patron, St. Denis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, enter the enclosure and examine the <span class='bold'>three round-arched
portals</span>. The <span class='it'>Central Doorway</span> has for its subject the
usual scene of the Last Judgment. The architecture of the
framework is still in the main that of the 13th cent. The
relief in the tympanum has been much restored, but still retains
its Romanesque character. In the centre is Christ,
enthroned, with angels. On His <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> hand, the blessed, with the
Angel of the Last Trump as elsewhere. On His <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, the condemned,
with the Angel bearing the sword, and thrusting the
wicked into Hell: all conventional features. The Latin inscriptions
mean, “Come, ye blessed of My Father”; and
“Depart from Me, ye wicked.” Beneath is the General Resurrection,
souls rising (mostly naked) from the tomb. To <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> and
<span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> of the doorway, below, are the frequent subjects of the Wise
and Foolish Virgins. Above, on the archway, figures of saints
and patriarchs, amongst whom is conspicuous King David.
Notice in the very centre or key of the archway, Christ receiving
souls from angels. To His <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, Abraham with three blessed
souls in his bosom (as at St. Germain l’Auxerrois). To His <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>,
devils seizing the condemned, whom they thrust into hell, while
angels struggle for them. Higher still, on the arch, angels
swinging a censer, and an angel displaying a medallion of the
lamb. This door formed the model on which those of Notre-Dame,
the Sainte Chapelle, St. Germain l’Auxerrois, and many
others in Paris of later date, were originally based. The actual
doors have naïve bronze reliefs of the Passion, Resurrection,
and Ascension. Notice the quaint character of these reliefs,
<span class='pageno' title='235' id='Page_235'></span>
and of the delicate decorative design which surrounds them,—broken,
in the case of the Supper at Emmaus, by the figure of a
monk, probably Abbot Suger, grasping a pillar. The Resurrection,
with its sleeping Roman soldiers, and the Kiss of Judas,
with Peter sheathing his sword and Christ healing the ear of
Malchus, are also very typical. Do not fail to notice, either,
the beautiful decoration of the pilasters and their capitals. All
this is delicate and characteristic Romanesque tracery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other doors commemorate the <span class='bold'>History of St. Denis</span>.
On the <span class='it'>South Door</span> is a much-restored and practically modern
relief of St. Denis in prison with Christ bringing him the last
sacrament; it has been largely made up by the aid of the old
French painting of the same subject in the Louvre. In front
are figures symbolical of his martyrdom—the executioner, etc.
On the sides, reliefs of the Months. On the <span class='it'>North Door</span>, St.
Denis condemned and on his way to Montmartre, with his two
companions, Rusticus and Eleutherius, chained; they are accompanied
in the sky by the Eternal Father and the heavenly
host. On the archway, interesting reliefs of the three martyrs,
with an angel supporting the châsse containing their relics.
On the sides, the signs of the Zodiac.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Walk round the <span class='bold'>North Side</span> to observe the decorated flamboyant
architecture of the chapels of the North Aisle (much
later) with the flying buttresses above them. Also, the North
Transept, with its rose window, and the peculiar <span class='bold'>radiating
chapels</span> around the <span class='bold'>apse</span>, which form a characteristic feature
of the Romanesque style. Observe these as well as you can
from the extreme end of the railing. Return to Transept. The
sculpture over the North Portal represents the Decapitation of
St. Denis. On the centre pier, a Madonna and Child. R and
<span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, Kings of Judah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The South Side is inaccessible. It is enclosed by buildings
on the site of the old monastery (not ancient—age of Louis
XIV), now used as a place of education for daughters of Chevaliers
de la Légion d’Honneur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='bold'>interior</span> is most beautiful. The first portion of the
church which we enter is a <span class='bold'>vestibule</span> or <span class='it'>Galilee</span> under the
side towers and end of the Nave. Compare Durham. It is
of the age of Abbot Suger, but already exhibits pointed arches
<span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span>
in the upper part. The architecture is solid and massive, but
somewhat gloomy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Descend a few steps into the <span class='bold'>Nave</span>, which is surrounded by
single aisles, whose vaulting should be noticed. The architecture
of this part, now pure Early Gothic, is extremely lovely.
The triforium is delicate and graceful. The windows in the
clerestory above it, representing kings and queens, are almost
all modern. Notice the great height of the Nave, and the
unusual extent to which the triforium and clerestory project
above the noble vaulting of the aisles. Note that the triforium
itself opens directly to the air, and is supplied with
stained-glass windows, seen through its arches. Sit awhile
in this light and lofty Nave, in order to take in the beautiful
view up the church towards the choir and <span class='it'>chevet</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then walk up to the Barrier near the Transepts, where sit
again, in order to observe the <span class='bold'>Choir</span> and <span class='bold'>Transepts</span> with the
staircase which leads to the raised Ambulatory. Observe that
the transepts are simple. The ugly stained glass in the windows
of their clerestory contains illustrations of the reign of
Louis Philippe, with extremely unpicturesque costumes of the
period. The trousers are unspeakable. The architecture of
the Nave and Choir, with its light and airy arches and pillars,
is of the later 13th century.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reason for this is that Suger’s building was thoroughly
restored from 1230 onwards, in the pure pointed style of that
best period. The upper part of the Choir, and the whole of
the Nave and Transepts was then rebuilt—which accounts for
the gracefulness and airiness of its architecture when contrasted
with the dark and heavy vestibule of the age of Suger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Note from this point the arrangement of the Choir, which,
to those who do not know Italy, will be quite unfamiliar. As
at San Zeno in Verona, San Miniato in Florence, and many
other Romanesque churches, <span class='bold'>the Choir is raised</span> by some
steps above the Nave and Transepts; while <span class='bold'>the Crypt</span> is
slightly depressed beneath them. In the Crypt, in such cases,
are the actual bodies of the saints buried there; while the
Altar stands directly over their tombs in the Choir above it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Look every way from this point at the tombs within sight,
at the Choir and Transepts, and at the steps of the Ambulatory.
<span class='pageno' title='237' id='Page_237'></span>
Do not be in a hurry to enter. On the contrary, sit
awhile longer in the body of the Nave, <span class='bold'>outside</span> the barrier,
and read what follows.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>[The custodians hurry you so rapidly through the reserved
part of the church that it will be well <span class='bold'>before entering the
enclosure</span> to glance through the succeeding notes, explanatory
of what you are about to see. The remarks to be read <span class='it'>as you
go round the building</span> I insert separately, in the briefest possible
words, as aids to memory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tomb of <span class='bold'>Louis XII</span> (d. 1515) and his wife, Anne de
Bretagne (d. 1514), is the earliest of the great Renaissance
tombs in France, and the first in order in this Basilica. Long
believed to be of Italian workmanship, it is now known to be
the production of Jean Juste of Tours, unknown otherwise,
but supposed to be a Florentine. It is imitated from the Giangaleazzo
Visconti, already mentioned, in the Certosa di Pavia.
This tomb, the first you see, struck the keynote for such works
of the Renaissance in France. It is a good and apparently
French imitation of the Italian original, and it fitly marks
Louis XII’s place in the artistic movement. Remember his
statue by Lorenzo da Mugiano in the Louvre, and his connection
with Cardinal d’Amboise and the Château de Gaillon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next important monument is that of <span class='bold'>Dagobert I</span> (d. 638),
the founder of the Abbey, probably erected in his honour,
as a sort of shrine, by St. Louis in the 13th cent. In order
to understand this tomb (which you are only allowed to see
across the whole breadth of the choir), it is necessary to know
the <span class='bold'>legend</span> to which the mediæval sculptures on the canopy
refer. When Dagobert died, demons tried to steal his soul;
but he was rescued by St. Denis, to whom he had built this
abbey, assisted by St. Maurice and St. Martin of Tours—a
significant story, pointing the moral of how good a thing it is
to found a monastery. The narrative is told in three stages,
one above the other. (1) An anchorite, sleeping, is shown by
St. Denis in a dream that the king’s soul is in danger; to the
<span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span>, Dagobert stands in a little boat (like the boat of Charon);
demons seize him and take off his crown. (2) The three
saints come to the king’s rescue, attended by two angels, one
swinging a censer, the other holding a vase of holy water; St.
<span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span>
Martin and St. Denis see the tortured soul; the soldier St.
Maurice, sword in hand, attacks the demons. (3) The three
saints, attended by the angels, hold a sheet, on which the soul
of Dagobert stands, praying. The Hand of God appears in a
glory above, to lift him into heaven. These are on the canopy;
beneath, on the tomb itself, lies a modern restored recumbent
statue of Dagobert; there are also erect figures of his son
Sigebert (restored), and his queen, Nantilde (original).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tomb of <span class='bold'>Henri II</span> (d. 1559) and his queen, <span class='bold'>Catherine
de Médicis</span> (d. 1589)—the third of any importance—was executed
by the great sculptor, Germain Pilon, during the lifetime
of the latter. (It was he, too, you will remember, who made
the exquisite group of figures, now in the Louvre, to support
the urn which was to contain their hearts.) As in many contemporary
tombs, the king and queen are represented alive
and kneeling, in bronze, above, and nude and dead in marble
on the tomb below. (We saw a similar tomb at the Louvre.)
A <span class='bold'>second monument</span>, close by, to the same king and queen,
has recumbent marble figures on a bronze couch,—Catherine is
said in her devouter old age to have disapproved of the nudity
of the figures on the first tomb—but as it was usual to distribute
relics of French kings to various abbeys, such duplicate
monuments were once common.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tomb of <span class='bold'>Frédégonde</span> (d. 597) from St. Germain-des-Prés,
is a curious mosaic figure of marble and copper, almost
unique in character. It is <span class='bold'>not</span> of the Queen’s own age, but
was added to her shrine in the 12th century. Most of
these early kings and queens, founders and benefactors of
monasteries, were either actually canonized or were treated as
saints by the monks whom they had benefited: and tombs in
their honour were repaired or reedified after the Norman invasion
and other misfortunes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two monuments of the <span class='bold'>children of St. Louis</span>, from other
abbeys, carried first to Lenoir’s Museum, are now in this Basilica.
They are of enamelled copper, with <span class='bold'>repoussé</span> figures, executed
at Limoges.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The most costly, though not to my mind the most beautiful,
of the Renaissance tombs is that of <span class='bold'>François I<sup>er</sup></span> (d. 1547). On
the summit are kneeling figures of the King, his wife Claude,
<span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span>
and their three children. The reliefs on the pedestal represent
the battles of Marignano and Cerisole. This tomb, like that of
Louis XII, is ultimately based on the Visconti monument in
the Certosa, but it exhibits a much later and more refined
development of French Renaissance sculpture than its predecessor.
It is by Germain Pilon, Philibert Delorme, and
(perhaps) Jean Goujon. The architectural plan is noble and
severe: but it lacks the more naïve beauty of Jean Juste’s
workmanship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the curious custom to treat the bodies of French
Kings (who, as royal, were almost sacred) much as the relics of
the Saints were treated. Hence the head and heart were
often preserved separately and in different places from the
body to which they belonged. François I<sup>er</sup> himself was
interred here: but an <span class='bold'>urn</span> to hold his heart was placed in the
Abbaye des Hautes Bruyères, near Rambouillet. This urn is a
fine Renaissance work by Pierre Bontemps. Taken to Lenoir’s
Musée des Monuments at the Revolution, it was afterwards
placed beside the king’s tomb in this Basilica.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Look out in the Apse for the Altar of St. Denis, and his
fellow-martyrs. Near it used once to hang the Oriflamme,
that very sacred banner which was only removed when a King
of France took the field in person. It was last used at Agincourt.
A reproduction now represents it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other monuments can be best observed by the brief
notes given as we pass them. The arrangements for seeing
them are quite as bad as those in our own cathedrals, and it
is impossible to get near enough to examine them properly.
Therefore, <span class='bold'>take your bearings from the Nave</span> <span class='it'>before</span> you
enter, and try to understand the architecture of the choir as
far as possible before you pass the barriers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Disregard the remarks made by the guide (who expects a
tip), and read these brief notes for yourself as you pass the
objects.]</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Enter the enclosure.</span></p>

<span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>**Tomb of Louis XII</span>, and his wife Anne de Bretagne, by
Jean Juste of Tours. After the Certosa monument. Beneath,
Twelve Apostles; four allegorical figures of Virtues: king and
queen, in centre, recumbent; above, on canopy, king and
queen kneeling. On base, reliefs of his Italian victories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>R, column commemorating Henri III, by Barthélemy Prieur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stand by <span class='bold'>steps</span> leading to <span class='bold'>raised Ambulatory</span>, only point
of view for <span class='bold'>**Tomb of Dagobert</span>, on opposite side of choir,
13th cent. Legend of his soul, see above. Erect statues of
Sigebert, his son, and Nantilde, his queen. Insist on time to
view it with opera-glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>L, <span class='bold'>**Tomb of Henry II</span> and Catherine de Médicis. King
and queen recumbent, in marble, below; kneeling, in bronze,
above. At corners, the four cardinal virtues, bronze. Also
after Certosa.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Ascend steps to Ambulatory.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Below, monuments of the Valois family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above, <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, second monument of Henri II and Catherine de
Médicis, recumbent marble on bronze mattress. Observe
monograms of H and D, as on Louvre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Proceed round Ambulatory. <span class='bold'>Chapels</span> to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span> have stained-glass
windows of 12th and 13th cents. Interesting subjects,
which note in passing. <span class='bold'>**</span>Beautiful <span class='bold'>view across the church</span>
as you pass the transepts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the centre of the <span class='bold'>apse</span> of the Choir (above the tombs in
Crypt), is the Altar of St. Denis, with his fellow-martyrs, St.
Rusticus and St Eleutherius—modern imitation of the original
shrine, broken at the Revolution. During the <span class='it'>neuvaine</span> (nine
days after St. Denis’ day—Oct. 9) the Reliquaries are exposed
in the Nave, near the barrier. On one side of the Altar is a
reproduction of the Oriflamme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond this Altar, continue along the South Side of the
Ambulatory, to the <span class='bold'>Sacristy</span>. Modern paintings, here, relating
to the History of the Abbey. Labels beneath describe
their subjects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Adjoining it is the <span class='bold'>Treasury</span>, containing only uninteresting
modern church utensils.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond the Sacristy, <span class='bold'>Tomb of Frédégonde</span>, from St.
Germain-des-Prés. Hands, feet, and face probably once
painted.
<span class='pageno' title='241' id='Page_241'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Descend steps from ambulatory.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Descend to Crypt.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>This, the oldest portion of the existing building, was erected
by Suger, to contain the Tombs of the Three Martyrs, buried
under their altar. Its architecture is the most interesting of all
in the Basilica. Notice the quaint Romanesque capitals of the
columns. In the centre, bones of the Royal Family, within the
grating. Neglect them, and observe the arches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the <span class='bold'>Crypt Chapels</span>, uninteresting modern statues (Marie
Antoinette, Louis XVI, colossal figures for the Monument of
the Duc de Berry, etc.). Neglect these also, and observe rather
the architecture and <span class='bold'>good fragments of glass</span> in windows,
particularly a very naïve Roasting of St. Lawrence.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Return to church.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Monument of Du Guesclin, 1380.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Louis de Sancerre, 1402.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Renée de Longueville, from the Church of the Célestins.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>Blanche and Jean</span>, children of St. Louis, enamelled copper,
Limoges; from other abbeys.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>**François I<sup>er</sup></span>, his wife, Claude, and their three children,
above. On pedestal, Scenes from his battles; High Renaissance
work: Philibert Delorme, Germain Pilon, and Jean
Goujon. More stately, but less interesting than Louis XII.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='bold'>**Urn</span>, to contain heart of François I<sup>er</sup>, from the nunnery of
Hautes Bruyères.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Louis d’Orléans and Valentine of Milan, from the Church
of the Célestins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Charles d’Étampes; 1336, with 24 small figures of saints.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Leave the enclosure and return to the church. I advise you
then to read this all over again, and finally, go round a second
time, to complete the picture.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The Abbey and Church are closely bound up at every turn
with French history. In Dagobert’s building, in 754, Pope
Stephen II, flying from the Lombards, consecrated Charlemagne
and his brother Carloman. In the existing Basilica, St. Louis
took down the Oriflamme to set forth on his Crusade; and
Joan of Arc hung up her armour as a votive offering after the
siege of Orleans. But indeed, St. Denis played an important
<span class='pageno' title='242' id='Page_242'></span>
part in all great ceremonials down to the Revolution, and its
name occurs on every page of old French history.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>On your return to Paris, you may find this a convenient
moment to visit <span class='bold'>St. Vincent de Paul</span>, which lies two minutes
away from the Gare de Nord.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>After visiting St. Denis the reader will probably find it
desirable to examine certain objects from the <span class='bold'>Treasury of the
Basilica</span> now preserved in the <span class='bold'>Louvre</span>. They are mostly
contained in the Galerie d’Apollon, in the glass case nearest the
window which looks out upon the Seine. (Position of cases
liable to alteration: if not here, look out for it elsewhere in
the same room.) The most important of these objects is an
antique Egyptian vase in porphyry, which Abbot Suger had
mounted in the 12th cent. in a silver-gilt frame, as an eagle. It
contains an inscription composed by the Abbot in Latin
hexameters, and implying that it was to be used for the service
of the altar. Near it is an antique Roman sardonyx vase, also
mounted as a jug by Suger in the 12th cent., and from the same
Treasury: its inscription says, “I, Suger, offer this vase to the
Lord.” Also, another in rock-crystal, which has been similarly
treated: it bears the name of Alienor d’Aquitaine: she gave
it to Louis VII, who passed it on to Suger: a 12th cent.
inscription on the base records these facts, as well as its dedication
to Sts. Rusticus and Eleutherius. The same case contains
a beautiful Carlovingian serpentine paten, which formed part
of the treasure of Dagobert’s Abbey. Observe, close by, the
beautiful silver-gilt Madonna, characteristic French work of the
14th cent., offered by Queen Jeanne d’Evreux to the Abbey of
St. Denis, and bearing an easily-deciphered inscription in old
French. Note that the Madonna in this royal offering carries
in her hand the fleur-de-lis of France. Compare this work
mentally with the other early French Madonnas we have
already observed in the Mediæval Sculpture Room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among other objects in this same case observe the curious
double cross, with cover and lid to contain it; where the inscription
above the head of the inner cross indicates the natural
origin of the doubling. Close inspection of this object will
<span class='pageno' title='243' id='Page_243'></span>
explain to you many little points in others. Several similar
Crucifixions, with Madonna and St. John and attendant
angels, are in the same room: compare them with it. To
the <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> is a good relief of the Maries at the Sepulchre; a
double crucifix with St. John and the Madonna; and a
reliquary fashioned to contain the arm of St. Louis of
Toulouse. Most of these objects are sufficiently explained
by the labels: the antique inscriptions, sometimes in Greek,
are easily legible. (Beautiful view out of window to <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The examination of this case will form a point of departure
for the visitor who cares to examine the <span class='bold'>minor art-works</span> in
the Galerie d’Apollon and other rooms of the Louvre. I have
left them till now, for the sake of the peg on which to hang
them. I will therefore note here, in this connection, one or
two other things which may assist the reader in the examination
of the remainder, leaving him, as usual, to fill in the details of
the scheme by personal observation and comparison of objects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Walk down the centre of the Galerie d’Apollon, on the side
towards the windows, passing the tawdry crown jewels, and the
many exquisite Classical or Renaissance works in the cabinet
beyond it, all of which you can afterwards examine at your
leisure. (Some of the antique busts in precious stones come
from Abbey Treasuries, where they were preserved and sanctified
during the Middle Ages.) But in the last case save one,
observe, near the centre, a very quaint little figure of St. Lawrence,
lying comfortably on his gridiron, and holding in his
hands a tiny reliquary, almost as big as himself—a finger with
a nail on it, intended for the reception of a bone of the Saint’s
own little finger. This odd little reliquary, French 14th cent.,
when compared with that for the arm of St. Louis of Toulouse,
will help you to understand many similar reliquaries, both here
and elsewhere. The martyr is put there as a mode of signifying
the fact—“This is a bone of St. Lawrence.” Above it,
note again five charming crosiers, containing respectively
representations of the Madonna enthroned, the Annunciation,
the Coronation of the Virgin, again the Annunciation, and a
decorative design of great beauty. Note their date and place
of origin on the labels. When once your attention has been
called to the occurrence of such definite scenes in similar
<span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span>
objects, you will be able to recognise them at once for yourself
in many like situations. In the Annunciation to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, observe
once more the very odd way in which the usual lily is carefully
obtruded between the angel Gabriel and Our Lady. Some
obvious barrier between the two was demanded by orthodoxy:
here, the decorative device by which the difficulty has been
surmounted is clever and effective. Between this crosier and
that of the Coronation, look again at a queer little reliquary,
held by the Madonna and Child, with a glass front for the
exhibition of the relic. Another Madonna, close by to the <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>,
similarly holds on her lap a charming little reliquary basin.
The same case contains several coffers and reliquaries in
<span class='it'>champlevé</span> enamel, the most interesting of which is the Coffer
of St. Louis, with decorative designs showing Romanesque
tendencies. At the far end of the case, two charming silver-gilt
angels, 14th cent., also bearing reliquaries. Examine in
detail all the objects in this most interesting case. They will
help, I hope, to throw light upon others which you will see
elsewhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not intend to go at equal length through all the cases in
this interesting room; but your visit to St. Denis ought now to
have put you in a fit frame of mind for comprehending the
meaning of most of these works by the light of the hints
already given. I will only therefore call special attention to
the beautiful decorative box, containing a book of the Gospels,
in French enamel-work and jewellery of the 11th cent., in
the last window on the right, before you reach the Rotonde
d’Apollon. This valuable book-cover is also from the Abbey
Treasury of St. Denis. It exhibits the usual Crucifixion, with
the Madonna and St. John, and the adoring angels, together
with figures of the symbols of the Evangelists, whose names
are here conveniently attached to them. The next case, to the
<span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> of this one, also contains <span class='it'>champlevé</span> enamels of the 12th and
13th cents., all of which should similarly be examined. Note
among them, to the extreme <span style='font-size:smaller'>R</span> in the case, a very quaint
quatrefoil with St. Francis receiving the Stigmata; a subject
with which you will already be familiar from Giotto’s treatment,
and whose adaptation here to a decorative purpose is curious
and enlightening. Next to it, <span style='font-size:smaller'>L</span>, a Death of the Virgin.
<span class='pageno' title='245' id='Page_245'></span>
Further on, two delicious little plaques—one, of Abraham and
Melchisedech, with St. Luke—(Abraham, as soldier, being
attired in the knightly costume of the Bayeux Tapestry); and
the other of the Offering of Isaac, with St. Mark; two of a
series of the Evangelists with Old Testament subjects. Above
these, the Emperor Heraclius killing Chosroes, with cherubim.
Still higher, a most exquisite Adoration of the Magi. Also
Christ in Glory, in a mandorla, with the symbols of the Evangelists;
and two closely similar Crucifixions, with a Madonna
and St. John, and adoring angels. Compare these with the
similar subject in the first case we visited. This frame also
contains three charming saints in Byzantine style, a good St.
Matthew, and a little King David holding a psalter. Do not
leave one of the objects in this window unidentified and
unexamined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I notice all these decorative treatments here merely in order
to suggest to the reader the way in which the knowledge he
has gained of the fabric of St. Denis may be utilised to examine
works of art from the great Abbey both here and at
Cluny. You will find it useful to visit both collections on your
return from such a church, in order to mentally replace in their
proper surroundings works now divorced from it. Some other
good objects from the same Treasury may also be seen at the
Bibliothèque Nationale.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='246' id='Page_246'></span><h1 id='ch7'><span style='font-size:smaller'>VII</span><br/> THE OUTER RING, ETC.</h1></div>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>[P</span></span>ARIS, <span class='bold'>outside the great Boulevards</span> comprises by
far the larger part of the existing city. Nevertheless,
it contains comparatively few objects of historical or artistic
importance, being almost entirely modern and merely residential.
Walks and drives in this part of Paris are pleasing,
of course, as exhibiting the life of the great town, and they
embrace many points of passing interest, such as the Trocadéro,
the Champs Élysées, the Champ-de-Mars, the Place
de l’Étoile, the Arc de Triomphe, the Parc Monceau, the
church of the Sacré-Cœur on the height of Montmartre, etc., etc.
Most of these the visitor will find out for himself. They do not
need any explanation or elucidation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the very few objects of historical interest in this
district, I would call special attention to the <span class='bold'>Maison de François
I<sup>er</sup></span>, on the Cours-la-Reine, at the first corner after you pass
the Palais de l’Industrie. This beautiful little gem of domestic
Renaissance architecture was erected for François I<sup>er</sup> at Moret,
near Fontainebleau, in 1527, probably as a gift for Diane de
Poitiers, the mistress of Henri II, though it is also asserted that
the king built it for his sister, Queen Margaret of Navarre. It
was taken down in 1826, and rebuilt on the present site. The style
recalls that of the Renaissance palaces of Venice. The delicate
and beautiful decorative work of the pilasters, etc., and the dainty
portrait medallions deserve inspection. Do not miss this
charming little building, which should be compared with Jean
Goujon’s portion of the Louvre, and with the Renaissance
remains at the École des Beaux-Arts and elsewhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A collection to which a few hours may be devoted, in the same
connection, by those who have time, is the <span class='bold'>Musée Carnavalet</span>,
<span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span>
which lies, however, <span class='it'>within</span> the Boulevards. The building is a
fine Renaissance mansion, once the residence of Madame de
Sévigné. Many of the objects preserved here have a purely
sentimental and to say the truth somewhat childish interest,
consisting as they do of relics of the Great Revolution or other
historical events, which derive whatever value they happen to
possess from their sentimental connection only. But some of
the objects have real artistic and historical importance; so
have the decorations by Jean Goujon. When you have seen
everything else enumerated here, you may give with advantage
a Thursday morning to this somewhat scratch collection.
The most important objects are those in the garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the Champs Élysées, the Arc de Triomphe, and the other
buildings or promenades of wealthy, modern, western Paris, the
guidance of Baedeker is amply sufficient.</p>

</div>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The buildings already enumerated and the objects noted in
them form the most important sights in Paris, and are as many
as the tourist is likely to find time for visiting during a stay
of some weeks. If, however, he can add a few days to his
sojourn, I give briefly some hints as to a list of other objects
worthy his notice—taking it for granted, of course, that he
will find his way to the Champs Élysées, the Bois de Boulogne,
the theatres, etc., by the light of nature, not unaided by
Baedeker. Amid the mass of information tendered in the
ordinary Guides, the visitor scarcely knows how to distinguish
the necessary from the optional. This short list may help him
in his selection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the old region on the South Side (between the river and
Cluny) are two churches worth inspection by the antiquarian:
(1) <span class='bold'>St. Julien-le-Pauvre</span>, the former chapel of the old Hôtel
Dieu, which here occupied both banks, spreading to the spot
now covered by the statue of Charlemagne; transitional; 12th
cent.; and (2) <span class='bold'>St. Séverin</span>, dedicated to two local Gallic
saints, of the same name; good flamboyant Gothic; its
interesting portal commemorates St. Martin, part of whose
famous cloak was kept in a chapel here; the <span class='it'>façade</span> was
brought from St. Pierre-aux-Bœufs, on the Île de la Cité, demolished
<span class='pageno' title='248' id='Page_248'></span>
in 1837; good modern reliefs on altar represent
episodes in the lives of the two saints—St. Séverin the Abbot
healing Clovis, and St. Séverin the Hermit ordaining St. Cloud.
Altogether, a church to be visited and understood, rich in
historic interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among churches of the later period, the <span class='bold'>domes</span> and their
development are worthy of study, as illustrating the ideal of the
17th and 18th cents. The earliest was <span class='bold'>St. Paul et St. Louis</span>
(originally Jesuit), 1627, with a massive and gaudy Louis XIV
doorway; interior, florid and tawdry, after the Jesuit fashion.
Next comes the <span class='bold'>Sorbonne</span>, 1635, interesting from its original
connection with St. Louis (his confessor, Robert de Sorbon,
founded the hostel, of which this is the far later church, for poor
theological students); it is the first important dome, and
contains an overrated monument to Richelieu by Lebrun,
executed by Girardon. If you have plenty of time, you may
visit it. Then the <span class='bold'>Invalides</span>, 1705, now containing the tomb
of Napoleon. Lastly, the <span class='bold'>Panthéon</span>, already described. If
visited in this order, they form an instructive series. Note the
gradual increase in classicism, which culminates in the
<span class='bold'>Madeleine</span>. The earlier domes resemble those of the Rome of
Bernini: the later grow more and more Grecian in their surroundings.
The <span class='bold'>Institut</span> (included here for its dome) and
<span class='bold'>Val-de-Grâce</span> are sufficiently inspected with a glance in
passing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The churches of the innermost Paris are mostly dedicated to
local saints; those of the outer ring of Louis XIV to a somewhat
wider circle of Catholic interest; among them, <span class='bold'>St. Roch</span>,
the famous plague-saint, deserves a visit; it is rococo and
vulgar, but representative. The churches in the outer ring are
of still broader dedication, often to newer saints of humanitarian
or doctrinal importance. Among these quite modern buildings,
<span class='bold'>St. Vincent-de-Paul</span> ranks first, on account of its magnificent
frieze by Flandrin, running round the nave, and representing a
procession of saints and martyrs, suggested by the mosaics in
Sant’ Apollinare Nuovo at Ravenna; this the visitor should on
no account omit; it lies near the Gare du Nord, and is a good
example of the basilica style, successfully adapted to modern
needs. Baedeker will here efficiently serve you. But, though
<span class='pageno' title='249' id='Page_249'></span>
artistically fine, Flandrin’s frescoes are not nearly so effective as
the original mosaics in Theodoric’s basilica. The other great
modern churches—St. Augustin, St. Ambroise, La Trinité,
Notre-Dame-de-Lorette, Ste. Clotilde, etc.—need only be visited
by those who have plenty of time, and who take an intelligent
interest in contemporary Catholicism. But, if you can manage
it, you should certainly mount the hill of <span class='bold'>Montmartre</span>, the
most sacred site in Paris, both for the sake of the splendid view,
for the memories of St. Denis (the common legend says,
beheaded here; a variant asserts, buried for the first time
before his translation to the Abbey of St. Denis), and
for the interesting modern Byzantine-Romanesque pile of
the <span class='bold'>Sacré-Cœur</span> which now approaches completion. Close by
is the quaint old church of St. Pierre-de-Montmartre, and
behind it a curious belated Calvary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those whom this book may have interested in church-lore
will find very full details on all these subjects in Miss Beale’s
“Churches of Paris.” Another useful book is Lonergan’s
“Historic Churches of Paris.” With the key I have striven
to give, and the aid of these works, the visitor should be able
to unlock for himself the secrets of all the churches.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Two pretty little parks which deserve a passing visit are the
<span class='bold'>Parc Monceau</span>, near the Ternes, and still more, the <span class='bold'>Buttes
Chaumont</span>, in the heart of the poor district of La Villette
and Belleville, showing well what can be done by gardening
for the beautification of such squalid quarters. The <span class='bold'>Jardin
d’Acclimatation</span> in the Bois de Boulogne, and the <span class='bold'>Jardin des
Plantes</span>, at the extreme east end of the South Side are both
interesting, especially to the zoologist and botanist. The last-named
is best reached by a pleasant trip on one of the river
steamers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of collections, not here noted, the most important is the
<span class='bold'>Musée Guimet</span> of Oriental art, near the Trocadéro. It should
be visited (if time permits) by all who are interested in Chinese,
Japanese, and Indian products. The <span class='bold'>Trocadéro</span> itself contains
a good collection of casts, valuable for the study of comparative
plastic development; but they can only be used to effect by
persons who can afford several days at least to study them (in
<span class='pageno' title='250' id='Page_250'></span>
other words, residents). The Ethnographical Museum in the
same building is good, but need only detain those who have
special knowledge in the subject.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>To know <span class='bold'>what to avoid</span> is almost as important as to know
what to visit. Under this category, I may say that no intelligent
person need trouble himself about Père-Lachaise and
the other cemeteries; the Catacombs; the various Halles or
Markets; the interiors of the Conservatoire des Arts et
Métiers (except so far as above indicated), the Bourse, the
Banque de France, the Bibliothèque Nationale (unless, of
course, he is a student and wishes to read there), the Archives,
the Imprimerie Nationale, the various Courts and Public
Offices, the Gobelins Manufactory, the Sèvres porcelain works,
the Institut, the Mint, the Invalides, the Chamber of Deputies,
the buildings in the Champ-de-Mars (except while the Salon
there is open), the Observatory, and so forth. In Paris proper,
I think I have enumerated above almost everything that
calls for special notice from any save specialists.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Three <span class='bold'>Excursions from Paris</span> are absolutely indispensable
for any one who wishes to gain a clear idea of the France of
the Renaissance and the succeeding epoch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first, and by far the most important of these, is that to
<span class='bold'>Fontainebleau</span>, a visit to which is necessary in order to
enable you properly to fill in the mental picture of the
change wrought by François I<sup>er</sup> and his successors in French
art and architecture. It is an inevitable complement to your
visits to the Louvre. This excursion, however, should only be
made after the visitor has thoroughly seen and digested the
Renaissance collections in the Louvre, and the École des
Beaux-Arts, as well as the Tombs of the Kings at St. Denis.
Baedeker is an amply sufficient guide for this the most interesting
and instructive excursion that can be made from Paris.
One day suffices for a visit to the Château and a glimpse of
the Forest; though a week can be pleasantly spent in this
charming region. After your return, you will do well to visit
the Renaissance Sculpture at the Louvre again. Many of the
works will gain fresh meaning for you after inspection of the
<span class='pageno' title='251' id='Page_251'></span>
surroundings for which they were designed, and the architecture
which formed their natural setting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second excursion, also valuable from the point of view
of the study of the Renaissance, is that to <span class='bold'>St. Germain</span>,
where the Château itself, and the exquisite view from the Terrace,
are almost equally delightful. Those interested in <span class='bold'>prehistoric
archæology</span>, too, should not miss seeing the very
valuable collection in the Museum installed in the Château,
probably the finest of its sort in the world, and rich in drawings
and other remains of the cave-men of the Dordogne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third excursion, in every respect less pleasing and instructive,
is that to <span class='bold'>Versailles</span>. This must be taken rather as
a duty than as a pleasure. Leave it for some enticing day in
summer. Neither as regards art or nature can the great cumbrous
palace and artificial domain of Louis XIV be compared
in beauty to the other two. The building is a cold, formal,
unimposing pile, filled with historic pictures of the dullest age,
or modern works of often painful mediocrity, whose very mass
and monotony makes most of them uninteresting. The
grounds and trees have been drilled into ranks with military
severity. The very fountains are aggressive. Nevertheless, a
visit to the palace and gardens is absolutely necessary in order
to enable the visitor to understand the France of the 17th
and 18th centuries, with its formal art and its artificial nature.
You will there begin more fully to understand the powdered
world of the du Barrys and the Pompadours, the alleys and
clipped trees of Le Nôtre’s gardens, the atmosphere that surrounds
the affected pictures of Boucher, Vanloo, and Watteau.
Take it in this spirit, and face it manfully. Here, again, the
indications in Baedeker are amply sufficient by way of guidance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When you have seen these three, you need not trouble
yourself further with excursions from Paris, unless indeed you
have ample time at your disposal and desire country jaunts for
the sake of mere outing. But these three you omit at your
historical peril.]</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>In conclusion, I would say in all humility, I am only too
conscious that I have but scratched in this book the surface of
<span class='pageno' title='252' id='Page_252'></span>
Paris. Adequately to fill in the outline so sketched, for so
great and beautiful a city, so rich in historical and artistic
interest, would require a big book—and big books are not easy
to carry about with one, sight-seeing. Moreover, I reflect by
way of comfort, it is not good for us to be told everything;
something must be left for the individual intelligence to have
the pleasure of discovering. All I have endeavoured to do
here is to <span class='it'>suggest a method</span>; if I have succeeded in making
you take an interest in Mediæval and Renaissance Paris, if I
have stimulated in you a desire to learn more about it, I have
succeeded in my object. However imperfect this work may
be—and nobody can be more conscious of its imperfections
than its author—it will be justified if it arouses curiosity and
intelligent inspection of works of art or antiquity, in place of
mere listless and casual perambulation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is common in England to hear superior people sneer at
Paris as modern and meretricious. I often wonder whether
these people have ever really seen Paris at all—that beautiful,
wonderful, deeply interesting Paris, some glimpse of which I
have endeavoured to give in this little volume. To such I
would say, when you are next at your favourite hotel in the
Avenue de l’Opéra, take a few short walks to St. Germain-des-Prés,
the Place des Vosges, St. Étienne-du-Mont, St. Eustache,
and Cluny, and see whether you will not modify your opinion.</p>
